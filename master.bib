	Abstract = {AbstractThe devastating civil war that began in Syria in March 2011 is the result of complex interrelated factors. The focus of the conflict is regime change, but the triggers include a broad set of religious and sociopolitical factors, the erosion of the economic health of the country, a wave of political reform sweeping over the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) and Levant region, and challenges associated with climate variability and change and the availability and use of freshwater. As described here, water and climatic conditions have played a direct role in the deterioration of Syria?s economic conditions. There is a long history of conflicts over water in these regions because of the natural water scarcity, the early development of irrigated agriculture, and complex religious and ethnic diversity. In recent years, there has been an increase in incidences of water-related violence around the world at the subnational level attributable to the role that water plays in development disputes and economic activities. Because conflicts are rarely, if ever, attributable to single causes, conflict analysis and concomitant efforts at reducing the risks of conflict must consider a multitude of complex relationships and contributing factors. This paper assesses the complicated connections between water and conflict in Syria, looks more broadly at future climate-related risks for water systems, and offers some water management strategies for reducing those risks.},

	Abstract = { ABSTRACT Currency crises are costly phenomena that have been exceptionally
	difficult to explain and predict. We comprehensively examine the
	relationship between political institutions and currency crises and
	emphasize the causal linkage between institutions, expectations,
	and crises. Specifically, we argue that institutional variables&mdash;particularly
	divided government and government turnover&mdash;increase the variance
	of expectations held by speculators thereby increasing the likelihood
	of currency crises. We test these hypotheses using three existing
	economic models of currency crises and find that institutional variables
	are not only statistically significant, but also substantially improve
	the ability of these models to forecast crises.We are grateful to
	Helen Milner, Charles Cameron, William Bernhard, and seminar participants
	at the University of Wisconsin and the University of Southern California
	for helpful comments. Lisa Martin and our referees provided feedback
	that helped dramatically improve our arguments and exposition. Andy
	Rose, Steve Kamin, Mathieu Bussiere, and Marcel Fratzscher generously
	provided data and advice that helped us replicate their findings.

@article{enders2005,
	Abstract = {Using time-series procedures, the authors investigate whether transnational
	terrorism changed following 9/11 and the subsequent U.S.-led "war
	on terror." Perhaps surprising, little has changed in the time series
	of overall incidents and most of its component series. When 9/11
	is prejudged as a break date, the authors find that logistically
	complex hostage-taking events have fallen as a proportion of all
	events, while logistically simple, but deadly, bombings have increased
	as a proportion of deadly incidents. These results hold when they
	apply the Bai-Perron procedure in which structural breaks are data
	identified. This procedure locates earlier breaks in the mid-1970s
	and 1990s. Reasonable out-of-sample forecasts are possible if structural
	breaks are incorporated fairly rapidly into the model.},

@article{krause1997,
	Abstract = {Theory: It is argued here that previous studies analyzing the formation
	of voters' economic expectations overlook important subtleties found
	in a differentiated (heterogeneous) electorate. Since different segments
	of the electorate possess varying information capabilities, it is
	asserted that they will form their prospective economic evaluations
	differently from one another. Hypotheses: The impact of "expectational"
	electoral cycles, news coverage of the economy reported by voters,
	retrospective economic evaluations, and personal financial expectations
	are hypothesized to have a differential impact on their economic
	expectations based on varying levels of information (education) among
	subsets of the electorate. Methods: Time series multiple regression
	analysis is conducted for the monthly period between January 1978
	and December 1990. The empirical analysis involves testing for the
	properties of the statistical time series (i.e., integration and
	cointegration) as well as specification of an error correction mechanism
	(ECM) that captures long-run statistical relationships in appropriate
	circumstances. Results: These findings uncover electoral heterogeneity
	(based on information/education differences) with respect to voters'
	prospective economic evaluations. Specifically, the information capabilities
	of voters is inversely related to their reliance on past/retrospective
	sources of information when forming both egocentric and sociotropic
	economic expectations. The main implication of this research is that
	the assumption of electoral homogeneity contained in previous longitudinal
	analyses of aggregate economic opinion formation provides misleading
	results that either overlook intra-electoral variations, introduce
	aggregation bias, or possibly both.},

@article{azar:1972,
	Abstract = {Over a period of time two nations establish between them an interaction
	range which they perceive as "normal." This normal relations range
	(on a scale from very friendly to very hostile) tends to incorporate
	most of a dyad's interactions and is bound by upper and lower critical
	thresholds. Conflict escalation is the movement to above the upper
	critical threshold, and conflict reduction is the return to below
	that threshold. Using the frequency and intensity of inter-nation
	events data coded from the 1956 Suez crisis (from July 26, 1956,
	through January 11, 1957) and a thirteen-point scaling instrument,
	the author shows that during the escalation phase (in comparison
	with preescalation and with conflict reduction phases) conflicting
	parties tend to (a) exhibit a symmetrical pattern of hostile interactions
	and (b) reduce the chronological time intervening between consecutive
	hostile interactions. Furthermore he shows that during conflict reduction
	the conflicting parties tend to exhibit (c) asymmetrical hostile
	interaction patterns and (d) increase the chronological time (or
	temporal distance) between consecutive hostile events. In an exploratory
	hypothesis the author suggests that conflicting dyads tend to reduce
	their hostile interactions to within their normal relations range
	when (1) they achieve or frustrate their goals, (2) incur heavy costs,
	or (3) they feel pressured by changes in the domestic and international
	environments.},

	Abstract = { This article describes the structure of the adolescent romantic and
	sexual network in a population of over 800 adolescents residing in
	a midsized town in the midwestern United States. Precise images and
	measures of network structure are derived from reports of relationships
	that occurred over a period of 18 months between 1993 and 1995. The
	study offers a comparison of the structural characteristics of the
	observed network to simulated networks conditioned on the distribution
	of ties; the observed structure reveals networks characterized by
	longer contact chains and fewer cycles than expected. This article
	identifies the micromechanisms that generate networks with structural
	features similar to the observed network. Implications for disease
	transmission dynamics and social policy are explored. },

@article{bennett:1999,
	Abstract = {Box-Steffensmeier and Jones (1997) provide a good overview of the
	class of models known as "event history" or "duration" models, but
	omit some important points about the relationship between duration
	dependence and time-varying data in parametric models of duration.
	The key reason to use duration analysis methods is to allow for the
	possibility of duration dependence in one's data. However, while
	assumptions about the form of duration dependence appear to be purely
	methodological, duration dependence can have important substantive
	implications for theories of politics. There is often an interaction
	in estimation between duration dependence and covariates. In particular,
	duration dependence can be revealed or eliminated when particular
	time-varying variables are included in or removed from a model. This
	point is especially important because time-varying covariates are
	more central and common to important research questions than is sometimes
	realized. Overall, these points lead to the conclusion that findings
	about duration dependence go hand-in-hand with proper specification
	and that model specification both in terms of functional form and
	included variables must be carefully considered before duration methods
	are applied.},

@article{benson:2004,
	Abstract = {An important question in the conflict processes literature concerns
	what types of international relationships are more likely to lead
	to peaceful interactions. Both security and economic ties have been
	posited as powerful determinants of conflict, yet their effects are
	often examined independently from one another. Furthermore, a debate
	exists as to whether it is states' ties to the international order
	or to each other that are most important in determining conflict.
	A resolution of the competing perspectives would expect that two
	states that have a tight network of security and economic relationships,
	both to each other and to the international order, should be extremely
	unlikely to engage in hostile action against each other. Surprisingly,
	a series of multinomial logits using non-directed dyads from 1951
	to 1985 suggests that dyads with tight economic and security ties
	at both the state-to-state and state-to-system levels are only slightly
	less likely to engage in dyadic disputes than those without such
	simultaneous ties. However, this study finds that both (1) tight
	security and economic ties to the international order and (2) tight
	intra-dyadic security and economic ties have important, independent
	effects in limiting dyadic hostility. This suggests that the states
	within a dyad have two separate paths to more peaceful interactions
	- the first lies in tightening ties between states, the second in
	strengthening dyadic security and economic ties to the international
	order.},

	Abstract = {Theoretical arguments and some empirical evidence suggest that war
	is more likely to occur between states that are geographically proximate,
	approximately equal in power, major powers, allied, undemocratic,
	economically advanced, and highly militarized than between those
	that are not. Bivariate analyses of these seven factors in relation
	to the onset of interstate war over all pairs of states in the period
	from 1816 to 1965 generally support these associations. However,
	multivariate analyses reveal some differences. In order of declining
	importance, the conditions that characterize a dangerous, war-prone
	dyad are: presence of contiguity, absence of alliance, absence of
	more advanced economy, absence of democratic polity, absence of overwhelming
	preponderance, and presence of major power. Taken together these
	findings suggest that our research priorities may be seriously distorted
	and that the idealist prescription for peace may be better than the
	realist one.},

	Abstract = {The authors draw on Klinenberg's (2002) ethnography and recent neighborhood
	theory to explain community-level variation in mortality during the
	July 1995 Chicago heat wave. They examine the impact of neighborhood
	structural disadvantage on heat wave mortality and consider three
	possible intervening mechanisms: social network interaction, collective
	efficacy, and commercial conditions. Combining Census and mortality
	data with the 1995 Project on Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods
	Community Survey and Systematic Social Observation, the authors estimate
	hierarchical Poisson models of death rates both during the 1995 heat
	wave and comparable, temporally proximate July weeks (1990-94, 1996).
	They find that neighborhood affluence was negatively associated with
	heat wave mortality. Consistent with Klinenberg's ethnographic study
	of the Chicago heat wave, commercial decline was positively associated
	with heat wave mortality and explains the affluence effect. Where
	commercial decline was low, neighborhoods were largely protected
	from heat-related mortality. Although social network interaction
	and collective efficacy did not influence heat wave mortality, collective
	efficacy was negatively associated with mortality during comparable
	July weeks (when no heat wave occurred). Unequal distribution of
	community-based resources had important implications for geographic
	differences in survival rates during the Chicago heat wave, and may
	be relevant for other disasters.},

@article{bueno-de-mesquita:lalman:1988,
	Abstract = {Systemic theorists emphasize the interplay of the distribution of
	power, the number of poles, and their tightness in predicting the
	occurrence of major-power war. The authors link individual-level
	incentives to these systemic constraints as factors that might affect
	the likelihood of war. They believe that their model specification
	is more comprehensive than any prior effort to evaluate the impact
	of structural attributes on the risk of major-power war. Empirical
	results from the individual-level prespective are encouraging when
	one examines European crises from 1816 to 1965, but there is no evidence
	that decision makers were significantly constrained by variations
	in the structural attributes. Neither the distribution of power nor
	the number of tightness of poles appears to influence the risk of
	war.},

	Abstract = { This article outlines the mechanism by which brokerage provides social
	capital. Opinion and behavior are more homogeneous within than between
	groups, so people connected across groups are more familiar with
	alternative ways of thinking and behaving. Brokerage across the structural
	holes between groups provides a vision of options otherwise unseen,
	which is the mechanism by which brokerage becomes social capital.
	I review evidence consistent with the hypothesis, then look at the
	networks around managers in a large American electronics company.
	The organization is rife with structural holes, and brokerage has
	its expected correlates. Compensation, positive performance evaluations,
	promotions, and good ideas are disproportionately in the hands of
	people whose networks span structural holes. The between-group brokers
	are more likely to express ideas, less likely to have ideas dismissed,
	and more likely to have ideas evaluated as valuable. I close with
	implications for creativity and structural change. },

	Abstract = {Does exposure to terrorism lead to hostility toward minorities? Drawing
	on theories from clinical and social psychology, we propose a stress-based
	model of political extremism in which psychological distress-which
	is largely overlooked in political scholarship-and threat perceptions
	mediate the relationship between exposure to terrorism and attitudes
	toward minorities. To test the model, a representative sample of
	469 Israeli Jewish respondents was interviewed on three occasions
	at six-month intervals. Structural Equation Modeling indicated that
	exposure to terrorism predicted psychological distress (t1), which
	predicted perceived threat from Palestinian citizens of Israel (t2),
	which, in turn, predicted exclusionist attitudes toward Palestinian
	citizens of Israel (t3). These findings provide solid evidence and
	a mechanism for the hypothesis that terrorism introduces nondemocratic
	attitudes threatening minority rights. It suggests that psychological
	distress plays an important role in political decision making and
	should be incorporated in models drawing upon political psychology.},

	Abstract = {Many empirical studies have found that disputes over territory are
	central to the outbreak and intensity of the majority of interstate
	military conflict. However, the existing literature lacks an explicit
	theoretical link between the role territory plays in disputes and
	the outbreak of violence as well as an exploration of how the control
	of territory is related to conventional military capabilities. This
	article demonstrates that the targets of territorial claims can consolidate
	their control over disputed territory to improve their ability to
	fight effectively on it. The empirical analysis suggests that when
	territory is strategically located, target states are more likely
	to consolidate their position, while challenger states are less likely
	to escalate militarily. Furthermore, when the presence of territorial
	characteristics such as strategic location makes consolidation an
	effective strategy, target states are increasingly likely to consolidate
	as they face stronger opponents.},

	Abstract = {ABSTRACT We argue that new international borders are rarely new. We
	propose that when states choose new borders they use previous administrative
	frontiers to solve a difficult short-term bargaining problem and
	a long-term coordination problem. With a unique new set of data collected
	specifically for this project, we systematically examine the new
	international borders of the twentieth century resulting from secession,
	partition, and the use of force. New international borders, we find,
	are drawn not according to principles of ``nationalism'' or defensible
	borders, but rather according to previous administrative frontiers.
	How borders are drawn has important consequences for international
	stability: borders drawn along previously existing internal or external
	administrative frontiers experience fewer future territorial disputes
	and have a much lower risk of militarized confrontation if a dispute
	emerges.},

	Abstract = {In recent years, constructivist thinking about global politics has
	brought a breath of fresh air to international relations. By exploring
	questions of identity and interest, constructivist scholars have
	articulated an important corrective to the methodological individualism
	and materialism that have come to dominate much of ir. As the books
	under review indicate, constructivism has also succeeded in demonstrating
	its empirical value--documenting a new and important causal role
	for norms and social structure in global politics. Theoretically,
	however, the approach remains underspecified. In particular, constructivists
	typically fail to explain the origins of such structures, how they
	change over time, how their effects vary cross nationally, or the
	mechanisms through which they constitute states and individuals.
	Missing is the substantive theory and attention to agency that will
	provide answers to such puzzles, as well as ensure the development
	of a productive research program.},

	Abstract = {While a growing body of work provides empirical support for the notion
	that political leaders "substitute" foreign policies depending on
	a variety of domestic political and economic conditions, little work
	examines the underlying strategic causes of substitution. This article
	argues that foreign states behave strategically in order to (a) avoid
	becoming the targets of domestically troubled executives or (b) to
	take advantage of the domestic trouble another state endures. Such
	"strategic interaction" delimits the set of foreign policies reasonably
	available to leaders in trouble at home, thus producing the impetus
	for policy substitution. This article develops a theoretical model
	of strategic behavior and policy substitution and reports empirical
	results of a multivariate probit model.},

	I expect a leader who offers unreciprocated cooperation to a rival
	(a dove) to be more likely to be deselected from power than a leader
	that takes a harder line vis-\{\`{a}\}-vis the rival (a hawk). I
	test expectation using event history techniques and data spanning

	pay an electoral price within a rivalry context. The findings suggest

@article{cornwell:laumann:etal:2008,
	Abstract = {For decades, scholars have wrestled with the assumption that old age
	is characterized by social isolation. However, there has been no
	systematic, nationally representative evaluation of this possibility
	in terms of social network connectedness. In this article, we develop
	a profile of older adults' social integration with respect to nine
	dimensions of interpersonal networks and voluntary associations.
	We use new data from the National Social Life, Health, and Aging
	Project (NSHAP), a population-based study of non-institutionalized
	older Americans ages 57 to 85, conducted in 2005 to 2006. Results
	suggest that among older adults, age is negatively related to network
	size, closeness to network members, and number of non-primary-group
	ties. On the other hand, age is positively related to frequency of
	socializing with neighbors, religious participation, and volunteering.
	In addition, age has a U-shaped relationship with volume of contact
	with network members. These findings are inconsistent with the view
	that old age has a universal negative influence on social connectedness.
	Instead, life-course factors have divergent consequences for different
	forms of social connectedness. Indeed, some later life transitions,
	such as retirement and bereavement, may prompt greater connectedness.
	We conclude by urging increased dialogue between social gerontological
	and social network research.},

	Abstract = {ABSTRACT Beck, King, and Zeng (2000) offer both a sweeping critique
	of the quantitative security studies field and a bold new direction
	for future research. Despite important strengths in their work, we
	take issue with three aspects of their research: (1) the substance
	of the logit model they compare to their neural network, (2) the
	standards they use for assessing forecasts, and (3) the theoretical
	and model-building implications of the nonparametric approach represented
	by neural networks. We replicate and extend their analysis by estimating
	a more complete logit model and comparing it both to a neural network
	and to a linear discriminant analysis. Our work reveals that neural
	networks do not perform substantially better than either the logit
	or the linear discriminant estimators. Given this result, we argue
	that more traditional approaches should be relied upon due to their
	enhanced ability to test hypotheses.},

	Abstract = {An analysis of the foreign policies of black African states toward
	industrialized nations in the middle 1960s is employed in a partial
	test of a theory of the foreign policies of subordinate states in
	asymmetrical dyads. In this theory, the interaction of two conditions--the
	state of a nation's economy and the extent of concentration in its
	linkages with a superordinate power--is used to explain the foreign
	policy actions of the subordinate state toward the superordiuate
	country. Directed dyads are divided into asymmetrical and nonasymmetrical
	sets, and the hypotheses are tested over both sets via regression
	analysis. The findings confirm the importance of structural asymmetry
	as a scope condition on the theory but offer only limited support
	for the use of the economic strength and linkage concentration variables
	in the explanation of foreign policy. The results also reveal that
	the influence of these two variables on foreign policy is not precisely
	as stipulated by the theory. For the more developed African states,
	relative economic strength in combination with highly concentrated
	linkages is associated, contrary to the theory, with a foreign policy
	of expanded relations with superordinate partners. For the less-developed
	states, this combination produces a foreign policy designed to restrict
	relations within the asymmetrical dyad as predicted by the theory.},

	Abstract = {International peacebuilding can improve the prospects that a civil
	war will be resolved. Although peacebuilding strategies must be designed
	to address particular conflicts, broad parameters that fit most conflicts
	can be identified. Strategies should address the local roots of hostility,
	the local capacities for change, and the (net) specific degree of
	international commitment available to assist sustainable peace. One
	can conceive of these as the three dimensions of a triangle whose
	area is the "political space"-or effective capacity-for building
	peace. We test these propositions with an extensive data set of 124
	post-World War II civil wars and find that multilateral, United Nations
	peace operations make a positive difference. UN peacekeeping is positively
	correlated with democratization processes after civil war, and multilateral
	enforcement operations are usually successful in ending the violence.
	Our study provides broad guidelines for designing the appropriate
	peacebuilding strategy, given the mix of hostility, local capacities,
	and international capacities.},

	Abstract = {This article focuses on the thirteen-odd bicommunal polities in which
	two, and only two, distinct communities dominate the political arena.
	The concept of a bicommunal polity is analytical rather than statistical.
	Permanent asymmetry characterizing the two components makes a simple
	majoritarian formula for decisionmaking processes unacceptable. What
	other decisional frameworks have a greater chance for success: federalism,
	federalism with a heavy dose of confederal ingredients, regional
	confederation, consociationalism or secession? A confederal modification
	of federalism has so far appeared as more acceptable to two asymmetric
	and antagonistic polities than a concept of a federal union with
	ts commitment to an overarching cultural-political national union.
	The high failure rate of bicommunal configurations points also to
	the necessity to relate the inner working of bicommunal polities
	to international balancing processes and/or support or abstinence
	of "blood-related" nation-states.},

	can and sometimes do fight when no peaceful bargains exist that both
	would prefer to war. Against this view, I show that under very broad
	conditions there will exist negotiated settlements that genuinely
	rational states would mutually prefer to a risky and costly fight.
	Popular rationalist and realist explanations for war fail either
	to address or to explain adequately what would prevent leaders from
	locating a less costly bargain. Essentially just two mechanisms can
	resolve this puzzle on strictly rationalist terms. The first turns
	on the fact that states have both private information about capabilities
	and resolve and the incentive to misrepresent it. The second turns
	on the fact that in specific strategic contexts states may be unable
	credibly to commit to uphold a mutually preferable bargain. Historical
	examples suggest that both mechanisms are empirically plausible.},

	a game-theoretic model of crisis signaling substantially refines

	behavior, measures of the relative strength of a defender's interests
	that are available before a crisis begins (ex ante) should be related
	to the failure of the defender's threats during the crisis. Ex ante
	measures of the defender's relative military strength should correlate
	with the success of the defender's crisis threats, but due to strategic
	dynamics that are not grasped by the standard arguments. A reanalysis

	Abstract = {An influential conventional wisdom holds that civil wars proliferated
	rapidly with the end of the Cold War and that the root cause of many
	or most of these has been ethnic and religious antagonisms. We show
	that the current prevalence of internal war is mainly the result
	of a steady accumulation of protracted conflicts since the 1950s
	and 1960s rather than a sudden change associated with a new, post-Cold
	War international system. We also find that after controlling for
	per capita income, more ethnically or religiously diverse countries
	have been no more likely to experience significant civil violence
	in this period. We argue for understanding civil war in this period
	in terms of insurgency or rural guerrilla warfare, a particular form
	of military practice that can be harnessed to diverse political agendas.
	The factors that explain which countries have been at risk for civil
	war are not their ethnic or religious characteristics but rather
	the conditions that favor insurgency. These include poverty-which
	marks financially and bureaucratically weak states and also favors
	rebel recruitment-political instability, rough terrain, and large
	populations.},

	Abstract = {It is common for scholars interested in race and poverty to invoke
	a lack of access to job networks as one of the reasons that African
	Americans and Hispanics face difficulties in the labor market. Much
	research has found, however, that minorities do worse when they use
	personal networks in job finding. Research in this area has been
	hampered by the complicated and multi-step nature of the job-finding
	process and by the lack of appropriate comparison data for demonstrating
	the various ways in which minorities can be isolated from good job
	opportunities. We seek to specify what it means to say that minorities
	are cut off from job networks. Building on the literature on social
	networks in the labor market, we delineate the various mechanisms
	by which minorities can be isolated from good job opportunities.
	We examine how these mechanisms operate, using unique data on the
	chain of network contacts that funnel to an employer offering desirable
	jobs. We find that network factors operate at several stages of the
	recruitment process. We find scant evidence, however, that these
	network factors serve to cut off minorities from employment in this
	setting. We conclude with a discussion of the theoretical and methodological
	implications of the case for the study of networks, race, and hiring.},

	Abstract = {Norms have never been absent from the study of international politics,
	but the sweeping "ideational turn" in the 1980s and 1990s brought
	them back as a central theoretical concern in the field. Much theorizing
	about norms has focused on how they create social structure, standards
	of appropriateness, and stability in international politics. Recent
	empirical research on norms, in contrast, has examined their role
	in creating political change, but change processes have been less
	well-theorized. We induce from this research a variety of theoretical
	arguments and testable hypotheses about the role of norms in political
	change. We argue that norms evolve in a three-stage "life cycle"
	of emergence, "norm cascades," and internalization, and that each
	stage is governed by different motives, mechanisms, and behavioral
	logics. We also highlight the rational and strategic nature of many
	social construction processes and argue that theoretical progress
	will only be made by placing attention on the connections between
	norms and rationality rather than by opposing the two.},

	Abstract = {This article tests the hypotheses that interstate war is more probable
	(a) between nation-states of approximately equal national power (power
	parity) and (b) between geographically proximate nation-states. The
	data base consists of thirty dyadic interstate wars during the period
	1816-1965. The analysis employs four indicators of national power:
	geographical area, population, fuel consumption, and steel production.
	Hypotheses are tested using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov one-sample test.
	The proximity hypothesis is confirmed (p&lt;.01). The power parity
	hypothesis is partially confirmed; except for the steel production
	analysis, all results are in the predicted direction. The population
	hypothesis is confirmed (p&lt;.025), and there is considerable support
	for the geographical area hypothesis (p&lt;.10). The findings justify
	further dyadic and nondyadic analyses and an effort to develop a
	power parity theory of interstate war.},

@article{geller:1993,
	Abstract = {The relationship between static and dynamic power distributions and
	war is a central element in the realist literature of international
	politics. The distribution of power and shifts in these distributions
	are held to be a principal source of conflict in works from Thucydides
	to Waltz. Most attempts to test empirically for a structural association
	between capability distributions and conflict have treated disputes
	as independent events; however, over the last two centuries a disproportionate
	amount of interstate conflict has occurred in the context of extended
	dyadic rivalries. This study focuses on the conflict patterns of
	these "enduring rivals." Based on a Markov chain analysis of 456
	militarized disputes occurring between 1816 and 1986, the findings
	indicate that power parity and shifts toward parity are approximately
	twice as likely to be associated with war as is a condition of power
	preponderance. By definition, rival dyads have issues in conflict.
	Equality of power or shifts toward equality create a situation in
	which both sides can perceive the potential for successful use of
	force. The findings generated in this analysis indicate that with
	such power distributions war between rival nations is most probable.},

	as determinants of socio-demographic homophily in friendship choice
	among students at a small college in the Northeastern United States.
	Using unique retrospective data, the paper first assesses friendship
	homophily over the four years of college. Friendship is homophilous
	across gender and race. QAP regression is used to determine the impact
	of both preference and propinquity (measured by participation in
	joint extra-curricular activities and shared academic major) on friendship
	choice. While preference predicts friendship choice in the freshman
	year, propinquity remains the strongest determinant of friendship
	choice over the four years.},

	higher than the Latin American rate of seven per 1000, and the incidence

	Although food and medicine are exempt, United Nations sanctions have
	had a negative impact on most of the population. In particular the
	embargo on fuel has limited most people's access to health care.
	The difficulties of distributing aid and health care without softening
	the embargo on fuel are immense, and the health of Haitians is not
	likely to improve until the political crisis is resolved.},

	Abstract = {International relations theorists disagree about whether great power
	behaviors reflect bureaucratic routine or reciprocity. Recently,
	some have suggested that these behaviors result from great powers'
	rational expectations rather than from simple routine or reciprocity.
	The debate is flawed in several respects. The quasi-experimental
	studies of great power behavior suffer from specification and measurement
	errors. Furthermore, most studies of great power behavior focus exclusively
	on the superpowers, without adequately appreciating China's role
	in world politics. We present an improved analysis that recognizes
	the potential effects of Chinese behavior and ameliorates the methodological
	flaws in existing work. The results indicate that the behaviors of
	the United States, the Soviet Union, and China are a relatively stable
	mix of bureaucratic routine and reciprocity. The results also indicate
	complex, asymmetrical connections among U.S.-Soviet, U.S.-Chinese,
	and Soviet-Chinese relations, consistent with the notion of a strategic
	triangle.},

@article{gourevitch:1978,
	Abstract = {The international system is not only an expression of domestic structures,
	but a cause of them. Two schools of analysis exploring the impact
	of the international system upon domestic politics (regime types,
	institutions, coalitions, policies) may be distinguished: those which
	stress the international economy, and those which stress political-military
	rivalry, or war. Among the former are such arguments as: late industrialization
	(associated with Gershenkron); dependencia or core-periphery arguments
	(Wallerstein); liberal development model (much American writing in
	the 50s and 60s); transnational relation-modernization (Nye, Keohane,
	Morse); neo-mercantilists (Gilpin); state-centered Marxists (Schurmann).
	Arguments stressing the role of war include those which focus on
	the organizational requirements of providing security (Hintze, Anderson),
	the special nature of foreign relations (classical political theory),
	territorial compensation (diplomatic history), and strains of foreign
	involvement (analysis of revolutions). These arguments provide the
	basis for criticism of much of the literature which uses domestic
	structure as an explanation of foreign policy, in particular those
	which (such as the strong-state weak-state distinction) tend, by
	excessive focus on forms, to obscure the connection between structures
	and interests, and the role of politics. These arguments also permit
	criticism of the notion of a recent fundamental discontinuity in
	the nature of international relations.},

	Abstract = {International relations scholars make frequent use of pooled cross-sectional
	regression in which N dyads over T time points are combined to create
	NT observations. Unless special conditions are met, these regressions
	produce biased estimates of regression coefficients and their standard
	errors. A survey of recent publications in international relations
	shows little attention to this issue. Using data from the period
	1951-92, we examine the consequences of pooling for models of militarized
	disputes and bilateral trade. When pooled models are reestimated
	to allow for stable but unobserved differences among dyads, the results
	are altered in fundamental ways.},

	Abstract = {This paper asks (a) why and how institutions change, (b) how an institution
	persists in a changing environment, and (c) how processes that it
	unleashes lead to its own demise. The paper shows that the game-theoretic
	notion of self-enforcing equilibrium and the historical institutionalist
	focus on process are both inadequate to answer these questions. Building
	on a game-theoretic foundation, but responding to the critique of
	it by historical institutionalists, the paper introduces the concepts
	of quasi-parameters and self reinforcement. With these concepts,
	and building on repeated game theory, a dynamic approach to institutions
	is offered, one that can account for endogenous change (and stability)
	of institutions. Contextual accounts of formal governing institutions
	in early modern Europe and the informal institution of cleavage structure
	in the contemporary world provide illustrations of the approach.},

	Abstract = {The newest liberal institutionalism asserts that, although it accepts
	a major realist proposition that international anarchy impedes cooperation
	among states, it can nevertheless affirm the central tenets of the
	liberal institutionalist tradition that states can achieve cooperation
	and that international institutions can help them work together.
	However, this essay's principal argument is that neoliberal institutionalism
	misconstrues the realist analysis of international anarchy and therefore
	it misunderstands realism's analysis of the inhibiting effects of
	anarchy on the willingness of states to cooperate. This essay highlights
	the profound divergences between realism and the newest liberal institutionalism.
	It also argues that the former is likely to be proven analytically
	superior to the latter.},

	Abstract = { This study examines whether structural properties of friendship networks
	condition the association between friends' delinquency and an individual's
	own delinquent behavior. Data from the Add Health allows a more accurate
	conceptualization of the peer network and a more rigorous measurement
	of peer delinquency than previous research. Findings from this study
	indicate that friends' delinquency is associated with an adolescent's
	own delinquency involvement. However, characteristics of adolescents'
	friendship networks, such as its density and adolescents' centrality
	and popularity, condition the delinquency-peer association. Network
	density, in particular, emerges as an important component of the
	delinquency-peer association, with very cohesive networks containing
	stronger delinquency-peer associations than those that are less cohesive.
	These findings suggest that it is necessary to consider the underlying
	structural properties of friendship networks in order to understand
	the impact of peer influence on adolescent delinquency. },

	Abstract = {Coherent democracies and harshly authoritarian states have few civil
	wars, and intermediate regimes are the most conflict-prone. Domestic
	violence also seems to be associated with political change, whether
	toward greater democracy or greater autocracy. Is the greater violence
	of intermediate regimes equivalent to the finding that states in
	political transition experience more violence? If both level of democracy
	and political change are relevant, to what extent is civil violence
	related to each? Based on an analysis of the period 1816-1992, we
	conclude that intermediate regimes are most prone to civil war, even
	when they have had time to stabilize from a regime change. In the
	long run, since intermediate regimes are less stable than autocracies,
	which in turn are less stable than democracies, durable democracy
	is the most probable end-point of the democratization process. The
	democratic civil peace is not only more just than the autocratic
	peace but also more stable.},

	Abstract = {Recent research on representational linkages between legislators and
	their constituents challenges the long-standing assumption that constituency
	preferences are exogenous to the linkage process, but does not clearly
	suggest the conditions under which a specific pattern of linkage
	should exist. Drawing on a diverse collection of prior research,
	we argue that issues that function as main lines of cleavage between
	competing political parties should be characterized by reciprocal
	linkages between mass and elite preferences, while highly complex
	issues on which party distinctions are unclear should be characterized
	by no linkages between mass and elite. For salient issues on which
	the public fails to distinguish party positions, we expect the traditional
	one-way linkage from mass to elite. We test our theoretical expectations
	with a unique version of the data from the 1958 American Representation
	Study-and with explicit predictions for which policy issues addressed
	in that study should demonstrate which particular pattern of mass-elite
	linkage. The empirical results, derived from LISREL analyses for
	three policy areas, are entirely in accord with our predictions.},

@article{hiscox:2001,
	Abstract = {Domestic political conflict has been a constant companion to international
	trade, but the nature of that conflict has varied greatly in Western
	democracies over the last two centuries. Political battles over trade
	policy appear to have sometimes divided societies along broad class
	lines and at other times split them into narrow industry-based coalitions.
	I argue that this diversity stems from historical and cross-national
	variation in inter-industry factor mobility. Class coalitions are
	more likely where factor mobility is high, whereas narrow, industry-based
	coalitions are more likely where mobility is low. Evidence from six
	Western economies for the last two centuries indicates that levels
	of factor mobility have varied historically and cross-nationally
	in accord with industrialization and regulation. This variation corresponds
	broadly with observable differences in the formation of trade policy
	coalitions.},

	highly structured by individual status in higher status contexts

	Abstract = {We examine the effects of individual political preferences and the
	distribution of such preferences on the social transmission of political
	information. Our data base combines a 1984 election survey of citizens
	in South Bend, Indiana with a subsequent survey of people with whom
	these citizens discuss politics. Several findings emerge from the
	effort. First, individuals do purposefully construct informational
	networks corresponding to their own political preferences, and they
	also selectively misperceive socially supplied political information.
	More important, both of these individual-level processes are shown
	to be conditioned by constraints imposed due to the distribution
	of political preferences in the social context. Thus, individual
	control over socially supplied political information is partial and
	incomplete. Finally, these information-transmitting processes interact
	with the social context in a manner that favors partisan majorities
	while undermining political minorities.},

	conflict initiation, and a cognitive psychological model of behavior
	emphasizing risk orientation and misperception. The results of probit

	Abstract = {ABSTRACT In this article, we explain the role of international law
	in the resolution of territorial disputes from 1945 to 2000. In doing
	so, we focus on three outcomes of interest. First, when do states
	choose to revise the territorial status quo through negotiations
	instead of force? Second, when are states able to reach a final settlement?
	Third, when do states prefer a process of legal dispute resolution
	(i.e., adjudication or arbitration) to bilateral negotiations? To
	answer these questions, we argue that when the legal principles relevant
	to the dispute are unambiguous and clearly favor one side, a law-based
	focal point will emerge. This focal point, in turn, facilitates the
	settlement process by helping leaders overcome distribution problems,
	a central obstacle in reaching a final agreement. We find strong
	and consistent empirical support for our hypotheses regarding international
	law and peaceful dispute resolution.},

@article{jervis:2002,
	Abstract = {The motor of international politics has been war among the leading
	states. The most developed states in the international system-the
	United States, Western Europe, and Japan-form what Karl Deutsch called
	a security community, which is a group of countries among which war
	is unthinkable. These states are the most powerful ones in the world
	and, so, are traditional rivals. Thus the change is striking and
	consequential Constructivists explain this in terms of changed ideas
	and identities; liberals point to democracy and economic interest;
	realists stress the role of nuclear weapons and American hegemony.
	My own explanation combines the high cost of war, the gains from
	peace, and the values that are prevalent within the security community.
	Whatever the cause, the existence of the community will bring with
	it major changes in international politics and calls into question
	many traditional theories of war.},

	Abstract = {Recent writings on problems of the international economy have focused
	attention primarily on changes in the international system. This
	paper attempts to show that foreign economic policy can be understood
	only if domestic factors are systematically included in the analysis.
	The paper's first part groups the recent literature into three paradigms
	which distinguish between three international effects. The second
	part offers a comparison of the differences between a state-centered
	policy network in France and a society-centered network in the United
	States. The third part of the paper combines the arguments of the
	first two and analyzes French and American commercial, financial,
	and energy policies as the outcome of both international effects
	and domestic structures. These case studies show that domestic factors
	must be included in an analysis of foreign economic policies. The
	paper's main results are analyzed further in its fourth part.},

	Abstract = {Over the past ten years or so there has been renewed research interest
	in the relative impact of peer selection and peer influence on the
	increasing similarity of teenagers in their substance use. Researchers
	have concluded that either peer selection or peer influence explained
	the similarity. This paper examines this research question differently
	using complete network data and arrives at different conclusions.
	Findings emonstrate that similarity in the substance use of teenagers
	and their peers is explained by either peer selection or peer influence
	for some, by both peer selection and peer influence for others, and
	by neither for others. Using a sociological approach and a social
	network perspective this paper demonstrates how chain reactions result
	in similarity in the substance use of teenagers in their peer groups,
	by drawing together those who are similar with those who are not.
	The paper demonstrates how chain reactions involve peer selection,
	the patterning of peer ties and peer influence, and explores how
	gender affects all aspects of the chain reaction process.},

@article{korinek:entwisle:etal:2005,
	Abstract = {A unique longitudinal and prospective approach is used to analyze
	the social embeddedness of rural-urban Thai migrants and their subsequent
	migration. More than any one particular social tie, it is the configuration
	of social ties at multiple levels that influences whether migrants
	experience their destination as integrative and a place for settlement
	or not. Social ties at multiple levels and from multiple sources
	weave into a social fabric that surrounds migrants in destination
	contexts, shaping their migration trajectories. The findings show
	that urban-integrated migrants with diverse social support ties in
	the urban destination who reside in village enclaves and households
	that promote social adaptation and incorporation tend to be found
	again in urban destinations 6 years later. By comparison, semi-integrated
	and urban-isolated migrants whose social support ties, community
	structures, and households provide relatively weak links and support
	within the urban setting exhibit stronger tendencies to return to
	their villages of origin or to migrate onward from their initial
	destination. The findings suggest that migrants' mobility pathways-whether
	they settle in their current destination, return to their villages
	of origin, or make additional movements onward-depend on the organization
	of urban social relations and migrants' positions therein.},

@article{krasner:1976,
	Abstract = {The structure of international trade, identified by the degree of
	openness for the movement of goods, can best be explained by a state-power
	theory of international political economy. This theory begins with
	the assumption that the nature of international economic movements
	is determined by states acting to maximize national goals. Four goals--aggregate
	national income, political power, social stability, and economic
	growth--can be systematically related to the degree of openness in
	the international trading system for states of different relative
	sizes and levels of development. This analysis leads to the conclusion
	that openness is most likely to exist when there is a hegemonic distribution
	of potential economic power. Time-series data on tariff levels, trade
	proportions, regional concentration, per capita income, national
	income, share of world trade, and share of world investment are then
	presented. The first three are used to describe the degree of openness
	in the trading system; the last four, the distribution of state power.
	The data suggest that the state-power theory should be amended to
	take into consideration domestic political constraints on state action.},

	Abstract = {This article examines the extent to which participation in high school
	interscholastic sports contributes to male violence. Deriving competing
	hypotheses from social control, social learning, and masculinity
	theories, I use data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent
	Health to test if (1) type of sport and (2) peer athletic participation,
	contribute to the risks of male serious fighting. Contrary to social
	control expectations, analyses suggest that athletic involvement
	fails to inhibit male violence. Moreover, there is a strong relationship
	between contact sports and violence. Football players and wrestlers,
	as opposed to baseball, basketball, tennis, and other athletes, are
	significantly more likely than nonathletic males to be involved in
	a serious fight. Additionally, the direct effect of football is explained
	by the football participation of individuals' peers. Males whose
	friends play football are more likely to fight than other males,
	supporting perspectives that emphasize peer contexts as important
	mediators. Overall, findings are consistent with the expectations
	of social learning and masculinity arguments. The theoretical and
	policy implications of these results are discussed.},

	Abstract = { ABSTRACT Currency crises are costly phenomena that have been exceptionally
	difficult to explain and predict. We comprehensively examine the
	relationship between political institutions and currency crises and
	emphasize the causal linkage between institutions, expectations,
	and crises. Specifically, we argue that institutional variables&mdash;particularly
	divided government and government turnover&mdash;increase the variance
	of expectations held by speculators thereby increasing the likelihood
	of currency crises. We test these hypotheses using three existing
	economic models of currency crises and find that institutional variables
	are not only statistically significant, but also substantially improve
	the ability of these models to forecast crises.We are grateful to

	to our understanding of international relations. I begin with the
	implications of loss aversion, the endowment effect, risk orientation,
	and framing for theoretical questions relating to the stability of
	the status quo in international politics, deterrence, bargaining,
	and preventive war. I then raise conceptual and methodological problems
	which complicate the theoretical and empirical application of prospect
	theory to international behavior. I illustrate my arguments with
	references to some recent attempts to use a prospect theory framework
	to guide case studies of crises decision-making. I conclude that
	in applying prospect theory to empirical cases, the analyst must
	demonstrate not only that empirical behavior is consistent with the
	theory but also that the observed behavior cannot adequately be explained
	by a rational choice model which posits the maximization of expected
	value.},

	winner well before the election actually occurs. After comparing
	the performance of several naive bivariate models based on economic
	performance, international involvement, political experience, and
	presidential popularity, we go on to formulate a multivariate model.
	This economy-popularity regression model rather accurately forecasts
	the winner 6 months in advance of the election, by employing spring
	measures of presidential popularity and the growth rate in real GNP
	per capita. Furthermore, the model's performance, both ex post facto
	and prior to the election, compares favorably with the Gallup final
	preelection poll taken only a few days before the election.},

	a function of both quarterly real GNP per capita growth and presidential
	popularity measured six months prior to the election, plus the time
	of the election (midterm or not). This model is more attractive than
	the earlier, strictly midterm, models propounded by Tufte and Hibbs.
	It is clearly superior in forecasting the 1982 results. In general,
	the model's forecasts for postwar House races are very close to the
	actual result, off only five or six seats at the median, regardless
	of whether the forecast is made ex post or ex ante. As a final exercise,
	we apply the model to 1984, in order to forecast the prospective

	Abstract = {We offer a model of incumbent party seat change in House elections
	which provides true forecasts-it "calls" the seat change well in
	advance of the election itself. The model predicts seat change as
	a function of both quarterly real GNP per capita growth and presidential
	popularity measured six months prior to the election, plus the time
	of the election (midterm or not). This model is more attractive than
	the earlier, strictly midterm, models propounded by Tufte and Hibbs.
	It is clearly superior in forecasting the 1982 results. In general,
	the model's forecasts for postwar House races are very close to the
	actual result, off only five or six seats at the median, regardless
	of whether the forecast is made ex post or ex ante. As a final exercise,
	we apply the model to 1984, in order to forecast the prospective
	Republican House seat change.},

@article{lizardo:2006,
	Abstract = {This article examines the relationship between different forms of
	cultural taste and the density of social contacts across alternative
	types of network relations classified by average tie strength. The
	author builds on Bourdieu's ([1986] 2001) classic statement on the
	"forms of capital" (economic, social, and cultural) and the conversion
	dynamics among them, and on DiMaggio's (1987) connection between
	cultural tastes and sociability. He hypothesizes that (1) in addition
	to cultural tastes being determined by network relations, cultural
	tastes are used to form and sustain those networks. Furthermore he
	expects that (2) highbrow culture taste will be less likely to be
	converted into social capital beyond immediate strong-tie circles
	due to its more restricted, "asset-specific" nature. Because of its
	generalized appeal, taste for popular culture will be more likely
	to be associated with weak-tie network density. The results broadly
	support these hypotheses: a model that specifies an effect of culture
	on network density provides a better fit to the data than the traditional
	conception of networks as determining taste. In addition using log-linear
	models and instrumental-variable methods, I show that popular culture
	consumption has a positive impact on weak-tie network density but
	not strong-tie network density, while highbrow culture consumption
	selectively increases strong-tie density but has no appreciable effect
	on weak ties, net of standard socioeconomic variables. These findings
	help to shed light on the mechanisms that translate mastery of different
	types of cultural knowledge into integration across distant social
	positions or closure around strong group boundaries. The author also
	discusses the implications of the results for current models describing
	the transformation of cultural into social resources.},

	Abstract = {The aim of this paper is to understand the interrelations among relations
	within concrete social groups. Social structure is sought, not ideal
	types, although the latter are relevant to interrelations among relations.
	From a detailed social network, patterns of global relations can
	be extracted, within which classes of equivalently positioned individuals
	are delineated. The global patterns are derived algebraically through
	a 'functorial' mapping of the original pattern. Such a mapping (essentially
	a generalized homomorphism) allows systematically for concatenation
	of effects through the network. The notion of functorial mapping
	is of central importance in the 'theory of categories,' a branch
	of modem algebra with numerous applications to algebra, topology,
	logic. The paper contains analyses of two social networks, exemplifying
	this approach. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

	Abstract = {Does a state's use of indiscriminate violence incite insurgent attacks?
	To date, most existing theories and empirical studies have concluded
	that such violence is highly counterproductive because it creates
	new grievances while forcing victims to seek security, if not safety,
	in rebel arms. This proposition is tested using Russian artillery
	fire in Chechnya (2000 to 2005) to estimate indiscriminate violence's
	effect on subsequent patterns of insurgent attacks across matched
	pairs of similar shelled and nonshelled villages. The findings are
	counterintuitive. Shelled villages experience a 24 percent reduction
	in posttreatment mean insurgent attacks relative to control villages.
	In addition, commonly cited "triggers" for insurgent retaliation,
	including the lethality and destructiveness of indiscriminate violence,
	are either negatively correlated with insurgent attacks or statistically
	insignificant.},

	freely than country-pairs composed of a democracy and an autocracy
	(Mansfield, Milner, and Rosendorff 2000). Xinyuan Dai (2002) incorrectly
	asserts that our conclusion depends on the preferences of the decision
	makers who formulate trade policy. We show that Dai fails to accurately
	replicate our model, and hence erroneously claims that the new equilibria
	she deduces are consistent with it. In addition, we demonstrate that
	in altering one of our assumptions, Dai offers a model that is less
	realistic as well as inconsistent with the substantive literature
	on international bargaining. Finally, we question the robustness
	of her approach. Due to these problems of replication, realism, and
	robustness, we conclude that Dai's model is of limited utility.},

	Abstract = {Our earlier article established that pairs of democracies trade more
	freely than country-pairs composed of a democracy and an autocracy
	(Mansfield, Milner, and Rosendorff 2000). Xinyuan Dai (2002) incorrectly
	asserts that our conclusion depends on the preferences of the decision
	makers who formulate trade policy. We show that Dai fails to accurately
	replicate our model, and hence erroneously claims that the new equilibria
	she deduces are consistent with it. In addition, we demonstrate that
	in altering one of our assumptions, Dai offers a model that is less
	realistic as well as inconsistent with the substantive literature
	on international bargaining. Finally, we question the robustness
	of her approach. Due to these problems of replication, realism, and
	robustness, we conclude that Dai's model is of limited utility.},

	Abstract = {Studies of international institutions, organizations, and regimes
	have consistently appeared in the pages of International Organization.
	We review the theoretical and empirical work on international institutions
	and identify promising directions for the institutionalist research
	program. Early studies of international institutions were rich with
	empirical insights and often influenced by theoretical developments
	in other fields of political science, but lacking an overarching
	analytical framework they failed to produce a coherent body of scholarship.
	Current efforts to reinvigorate the study of international institutions
	draw on a new body of theory about domestic institutions. We argue
	that the assumptions of this new approach to institutions are more
	appropriate to international studies than those of earlier attempts
	to transfer theories across levels of analysis. We suggest that the
	most productive questions for future research will focus on specifying
	alternative mechanisms by which institutions can influence outcomes
	and identify particular sets of questions within this agenda that
	are especially promising.},

	Abstract = {Have the core discussion networks of Americans changed in the past
	two decades? In 1985, the General Social Survey (GSS) collected the
	first nationally representative data on the confidants with whom
	Americans discuss important matters. In the 2004 GSS the authors
	replicated those questions to assess social change in core network
	structures. Discussion networks are smaller in 2004 than in 1985.
	The number of people saying there is no one with whom they discuss
	important matters nearly tripled. The mean network size decreases
	by about a third (one confidant), from 2.94 in 1985 to 2.08 in 2004.
	The modal respondent now reports having no confidant; the modal respondent
	in 1985 had three confidants. Both kin and non-kin confidants were
	lost in the past two decades, but the greater decrease of non-kin
	ties leads to more confidant networks centered on spouses and parents,
	with fewer contacts through voluntary associations and neighborhoods.
	Most people have densely interconnected confidants similar to them.
	Some changes reflect the changing demographics of the U.S. population.
	Educational heterogeneity of social ties has decreased, racial heterogeneity
	has increased. The data may overestimate the number of social isolates,
	but these shrinking networks reflect an important social change in
	America},

	Abstract = {The ubiquitous yet inaccurate belief in international relations scholarship
	that cognitive biases and emotion cause only mistakes distorts the
	field's understanding of the relationship between rationality and
	psychology in three ways. If psychology explains only mistakes (or
	deviations from rationality), then (1) rationality must be free of
	psychology; (2) psychological explanations require rational baselines;
	and (3) psychology cannot explain accurate judgments. This view of
	the relationship between rationality and psychology is coherent and
	logical, but wrong. Although undermining one of these three beliefs
	is sufficient to undermine the others, I address each belief-or myth-in
	turn. The point is not that psychological models should replace rational
	models, but that no single approach has a lock on understanding rationality.
	In some important contexts (such as in strategic choice) or when
	using certain concepts (such as trust, identity, justice, or reputation),
	an explicitly psychological approach to rationality may beat a rationalist
	one.},

	Abstract = {Poliheuristic theory (PH) bridges the gap between cognitive and rational
	theories of decision making. PH postulates a two-stage decision process.
	During the first stage, the set of possible options is reduced by
	applying a "noncompensatory principle" to eliminate any alternative
	with an unacceptable return on a critical, typically political, decision
	dimension. Once the choice set has been reduced to alternatives that
	are acceptable to the decision maker, the process moves to a second
	stage, during which the decision maker uses more analytic processing
	in an attempt to minimize risks and maximize benefits. In this article,
	the author applies poliheuristic theory to individual, sequential,
	and interactive decision settings. Subsequent articles in this issue
	offer theoretical extensions and multiple tests of the theory using
	multiple methods (formal, statistical, experimental).},

	Abstract = {Economic and organizational sociologists have increasingly demonstrated
	that the actions of individuals and firms are affected by the social
	networks within which they are embedded. In recent years scholars
	have begun to recognize that the effects of these social networks
	may vary across populations or types of relations. This article examines
	the extent to which the effects of interfirm networks on the behavior
	of firms are historically contingent. Focusing on the level of debt
	financing among approximately 140 large U.S. corporations over a
	22-year period, the authors show that the extent to which the firms'use
	of debt was influenced by those with which they were tied through
	director interlocks declined over time. The authors argue that this
	decline in the network effect reflected a shift in the institutional
	environment within which the firms operated, and that it was driven
	by three processes: the professionalization of the finance function
	within the firm, the internalization of financial decision-making,
	and the increased volatility of the environment. They conclude that
	corporate financing is socially embedded, but this embeddedness is
	historically contingent.},

	by pooling information from multiple forecast models to generate
	ensemble predictions similar to a weighted average of component forecasts.
	The weight assigned to each forecast is calibrated via its performance
	in some validation period. The aim is not to choose some {\`O}best{\'O}
	model, but rather to incorporate the insights and knowledge implicit
	in various forecasting efforts via statistical postprocessing. After
	presenting the method, we show that EBMA increases the accuracy of
	out-of-sample forecasts relative to component models in three applied
	examples: predicting the occurrence of insurgencies around the Pacific
	Rim, forecasting vote shares in U.S. presidential elections, and

	Recent work in the sociology of knowledge demonstrates a direct linkage
	between social interaction patterns and the structure of ideas, suggesting
	that scientific collaboration networks affect scientific practice.
	I test three competing models for sociological collaboration networks
	and find that a structurally cohesive core that has been growing
	steadily since the early 1960s characterizes the discipline's coauthorship
	network. The results show that participation in the sociology collaboration
	network depends on research specialty and that quantitative work
	is more likely to be coauthored than non-quantitative work. However,
	structural embeddedness within the network core given collaboration
	is largely unrelated to specialty area. This pattern is consistent
	with a loosely overlapping specialty structure that has potentially
	integrative implications for theoretical development in sociology.},

	observations on hundreds, sometimes thousands, of dyads or pairs
	of states. These observations miss elementary features of inter-state

	of war and peace. The way in which three prominent studies (Bremer,
	1992; Bueno de Mesquita, 1981; 1985) chose to count the Seven Weeks
	War dramatically reveals the theoretical difficulties when tallying
	dyads. Re-analyses of these studies demonstrate the sensitivity of
	the results to particulars of 1866 Germany and, more importantly,
	illustrate the merits of analyzing the dispute rather than the state
	dyad or the state-dyad year. /// L'{\'e}tude quantitative des p{\'e}riodes

	Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health) to examine the
	effect of racial residential segregation on school friendship segregation
	in the United States. The use of hierarchical models allows the authors
	to simultaneously estimate the effects of race, within-school residential
	segregation, and school diversity on friendship choice using the
	Add Health data. The authors use these results to predict the decline
	in friendship segregation that would occur if across- and within-school
	residential segregation were eliminated in U.S. metropolitan areas.
	The results suggest that about a third of the level of racial friendship
	segregation in schools is attributable to residential segregation.
	Most of this effect is the result of residential segregation across

	Abstract = {The birth of a new form of business organization, the partnership
	system, in Renaissance Florence is examined closely in order to discover
	the social processes of invention in that extraordinarily inventive
	place. Stated generally, the processes of invention the authors discover
	there are transposition, refunctionality, and catalysis across multiple
	social networks. Specifically, political co-optation of cambio bankers
	in the aftermath of the Ciompi revolt induced the transposition of
	domestic guild methods to the international plane, thereby changing
	their purpose and their reach. Subsequent social absorption through
	marriage of these elevated bankers into the victorious political
	alliance infused partnership with the multiplex logic (and often
	money) of dowry, thereby reproducing partnership systems as an integral
	component in post-Ciompi republicanism. Medieval organizational logics
	of patrilineage and guild were transformed into Renaissance organizational
	logics of marriage and clientage. The origins of financial capitalism
	are partly rooted in this elite social-network response to class
	revolt.},

	energy politics. The model we developed states that conflict and
	cooperation between importers and exporters of oil are related to
	the development of oil issues by the host countries which are undergoing
	the process of oil industrialization. Three issue sets are identified
	and each is related to the foreign policy behavior of the exporters
	directed toward the western oil importers. The issue sets include
	(1) development of the emergent oil industries, (2) distribution
	of the profits therefrom, and (3) the control and ownership of the
	oil industries. The model depicting aspects of the evolution of oil
	issues is operationalized utilizing difference equations, and correspondence
	with event/interaction data is tested for two cases: Iran and Saudi
	Arabia. Between 53% and 98% of the variance in measured cooperative
	and conflictual petroleum behavior is explained.},

	Adolescents who adapt their substance use behaviour to match that

	software to illustrate the co-evolution of friendship networks, smoking,
	cannabis use and drinking among sport-active teenagers. Results indicate
	strong network selection effects occurring with a preference for
	same sex reciprocated relationships in closed networks. Assimilation
	occurs among cannabis and alcohol but not tobacco users. Homophily
	prevails among tobacco and alcohol users. Cannabis use influences
	smoking behavior positively (i.e., increasing cannabis increases
	smoking). Weaker effects include drinkers smoking more and cannabis
	users drinking more. Homophily and assimilation are not significant
	mechanisms with regard to sporting activity for any substance. There
	is, however, a significant reduction of sporting activity among smokers.
	Also, girls engaged in less sport than boys. Some recommendations

	Abstract = {The rise in the importance of nonstate actors in generating new norms
	in world politics has been documented by scholars, but the literature
	has focused predominantly on nonsecurity ("new") issue areas. Conversely,
	although recent constructivist work in international relations has
	examined the security policies of states, typically it is the state
	that is doing the constrncting of interests. I bridge these two literatures
	by examining the hard case of transnational civil society working
	through issue networks to teach state interests in security policy.
	I analyze the campaign by transnational civil society to generate
	an international norm prohibiting antipersonnel land mines and trace
	the effects of several techniques through which states can be said
	to be socialized. Through generating issues, networking, "grafting,"
	and using a transnational Socratic method to reverse burdens of proof,
	the campaign has stimulated systemic normative change through two
	processes: norm adoption through the conversion of persuaded moral
	entrepreneurs and emulation resulting from social pressures of identity.},

	Abstract = {This article examines the foreign policy behavior of two rival states,
	India and Pakistan. Previous studies of this dyad reveal competing
	causal claims concerning the nature of Indian and Pakistani relations.
	I argue that Indian and Pakistani foreign policy behavior exhibits
	strong short-term relations in the context of long-term "memories"
	that shape future expectations of their bilateral relations. The
	results indicate that reciprocity in Indo-Pakistani relations is
	shaped by a long-term equilibrium and suggest a reconceptualization
	of the nature of the Indo-Pakistani relations. The findings highlight
	the legacy of suspicions between these two countries, providing sober
	insights into the possibilities for reducing conflict and promoting
	cooperation in South Asia.},

	produce different representations of reality? This question is explored
	through an analysis of the 1976 Lebanese Crisis. A comparison is
	made between Dawisha's (1980) analysis of Syrian decisionmaking processes
	and an events data-based early warning indicator. The study investigates
	whether the quantitative shifts in the interactions among Lebanese
	groups correspond with what the Syrians perceived to be critical
	turning points in the civil war. The evidence indicates for the most
	part there is congruence. It suggests that monadic and dyadic perspectives
	are not always far apart in their intellectual appraisal of crises
	and that a call for a synthesis in the study of crisis management
	is not unreasonable.},

	Abstract = {In this article I argue that much of the inconsistency in the scholarly
	literature on conflict escalation can be attributed to selection
	bias. To control this bias statistically, I use a censored probit
	model to evaluate hypotheses about conflict escalation over the time
	period of 1950-1985. I report four results. (1) Power parity and
	economic development are found to influence conflict nonmonotonically
	(2) Although joint democracy and joint satisfaction with the status
	quo are found to have robust pacifying effects on the onset of conflict,
	the results suggest that they are unrelated to the escalation of
	disputes to war. (3) Allied pairs of states appear less likely to
	escalate their disputes. (4) Finally, the unified model suggests
	that it is essential for researchers interested in the escalation
	behavior of states to consider first how states become involved in
	disputes. Conflict onset and escalation appear to be related processes.},

@article{reuveny:li:2003a,
	Abstract = {Many statistical studies in international relations investigate the
	claim that democracies do not fight one another. Virtually all of
	these studies employ a single-equation design, where the dependent
	variable measures the presence or absence of a dyadic militarized
	interstate dispute (MID). A separate group of studies argues that
	conflict affects democracy and that its effect could be positive
	or negative. By and large, these two bodies of literature have not
	incorporated one another's insights. We argue that democracy and
	dyadic conflict affect each other significantly and that statistical
	models that ignore the reciprocal nature of these effects may make
	incorrect inferences. To test this argument, we develop a simultaneous
	equations model of democracy and dyadic conflict. Our sample includes
	all the politically relevant dyads from 1950 to 1992. We find that
	dyadic military disputes reduce joint democracy and joint democracy
	reduces the probability of MIDs. Compared with the single-equation
	estimates in the literature, the absolute effect of joint democracy
	in our paper is smaller while in relative terms, the effect is similar
	in size. The effect of joint democracy on MID involvement is considerably
	smaller for noncontiguous countries than for contiguous ones. The
	effects of a number of control variables in the MID equation are
	also found to differ from those reported previously in single-equation-based
	studies.},

@article{ruggie:1998,
	Abstract = {Social constructivism in international relations has come into its
	own during the past decade, not only as a metatheoretical critique
	of currently dominant neo-utilitarian approaches (neorealism and
	neoliberal institutionalism) but increasingly in the form of detailed
	empirical findings and theoretical insights. Constrnctivism addresses
	many of the same issues addressed by neo-utilitarianism, though from
	a different vantage and, therefore, with different effect. It also
	concerns itself with issues that neo-utilitarianism treats by assumption,
	discounts, ignores, or simply cannot apprehend within its characteristic
	ontology and/or epistemology. The constructivist project has sought
	to open up the relatively narrow theoretical confines of conventional
	approaches--by pushing them back to problematize the interests and
	identities of actors; deeper to incorporate the intersubjective bases
	of social action and social order; and into the dimensions of space
	and time to establish international structure as contingent practice,
	constraining social action but also being (re)created and, therefore,
	potentially transformed by it.},

	Abstract = {The research presented here addresses a longstanding but previously
	unsupported theoretical proposition related to social learning in
	the demographic literature. This is that individuals should respond
	to lower (higher) infant mortality of socially proximate others with
	decreased (increased) fertility. On a more general level this problem
	directly concerns the translation of the effects of macro-demographic
	forces such as mortality into micro-level individual behavior through
	social interaction. Using unique data that combine identification
	of individuals belonging to women's social networks with direct measurement
	of these network members' mortality experience, this research demonstrates
	such a linkage. Information concerning the level and variation in
	infant mortality available to women from a small Nepalese mountain
	population in their social networks is seen to influence the tempo
	of their fertility. It is suggested that the methodology employed
	has important implications for quantitative analyses of reciprocal
	processes of social construction and micro-macro linkages more generally.},

	Abstract = {The hypothesis tested is that the speed of the change in the ratio
	of material capability of two proximate national actors predicts
	to the onset of an event, for example, war or peace. It is further
	posited that a faster rate of change is perceived by decision-makers
	as threatening, and, thus, they prepare for and initiate war. Utilizing
	COW data to establish system share capability and thereby determine
	velocity of dyadic ratio change prior to the event (war or no war),
	the hypothesis was tested controlling for contiguity and century.
	The findings give moderate to strong support to the theory. In general,
	the trend was in the right direction. In addition, low velocity of

	Abstract = {We present a unified theory and test of extended immediate deterrence-unified
	in the sense that we employ our theoretical deterrence model as our
	statistical model in the empirical analysis. The theoretical model
	is a straightforward formalization of the deterrence logic in Huth
	(1988) and Huth and Russett (1984), coupled with private information
	concerning utilities. Our statistical analysis suggests that the
	attacker and defender's decisions are influenced by the balance of
	forces, nuclear weapons, defender-protege military alliances, arms
	transfers, and trade, as well as the regime types of those involved.
	Many of these findings contradict previous research by Huth (1988)
	and Huth and Russett (1988). We find that many of the variables involved
	in the deterrence calculus are nonmonotonically linked to the probability
	of deterrence success or war. We illustrate the results with case
	studies of the Soviet-Japanese dispute over Manchukuo (1937-1938)
	and the Berlin Blockade (1948).},

@article{snijders:pattison:etal:2006,
	Abstract = {The most promising class of statistical models for expressing structural
	properties of social networks observed at one moment in time is the
	class of exponential random graph models (ERGMs), also known as p*
	models. The strong point of these models is that they can represent
	a variety of structural tendencies, such as transitivity, that define
	complicated dependence patterns not easily modeled by more basic
	probability models. Recently, Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms
	have been developed that produce approximate maximum likelihood estimators.
	Applying these models in their traditional specification to observed
	network data often has led to problems, however, which can be traced
	back to the fact that important parts of the parameter space correspond
	to nearly degenerate distributions, which may lead to convergence
	problems of estimation algorithms, and a poor fit to empirical data.
	This paper proposes new specifications of exponential random graph
	models. These specifications represent structural properties such
	as transitivity and heterogeneity of degrees by more complicated
	graph statistics than the traditional star and triangle counts. Three
	kinds of statistics are proposed: geometrically weighted degree distributions,
	alternating k-triangles, and alternating independent two-paths. Examples
	are presented both of modeling graphs and digraphs, in which the
	new specifications lead to much better results than the earlier existing
	specifications of the ERGM. It is concluded that the new specifications
	increase the range and applicability of the ERGM as a tool for the
	statistical analysis of social networks.},

	Abstract = {To model, from its inception, interenterprise network formation and
	its interaction with foreign investment across an entire epoch of
	rapid and profound economic transformation, the authors gathered
	data on the complete ownership histories of 1,696 of the largest
	Hungarian enterprises from 1987 to 2001. They develop a social sequence
	analysis to identify distinctive pathways whereby firms use network
	resources to buffer uncertainty, hide or restructure assets, or gain
	knowledge and legitimacy. During this period, networked property
	grew, stabilized, and involved a growing proportion of foreign capital.
	Cohesive networks of recombinant property were robust, and in fact
	integrated foreign investment. Although multinationals, through their
	subsidiaries, dissolved ties in joint venture arrangements, the authors
	find evidence that they also built durable networks. These findings
	suggest that developing economies do not necessarily face a forced
	choice between networks of global reach and those of local embeddedness.},

@article{sweeney:2003,
	Abstract = {Two fundamental arguments are presented to answer whether dyadic balances
	or preponderances of military capability are more peaceful. First,
	the impact of the dyadic balance of military capabilities on interstate
	conflict, conditional on the level of dyadic interest similarity,
	is assessed. Many theoretical works in the field argue that the degree
	of interest similarity gives meaning to the balance of military forces,
	yet few empirical studies investigate the conditionality of these
	two variables. The second argument is that interstate conflict is
	a heterogeneous outcome. A selection model that seeks to explain
	the severity of interstate disputes is used to address this concern.
	Using data from all interstate dyads between 1886 and 1992, results
	show that dyads with similar interests have less severe disputes,
	and under the condition of interest dissimilarity, balances rather
	than preponderances of military capability are associated with less
	severe disputes.},

	six demographic variables--age, gender, race, education, and company
	and job tenure--on superiors' ratings of performance and liking for
	subordinates and subordinates' role ambiguity and conflict. A field
	study of 272 superior-subordinate dyads produced results that support
	the notion that increasing dissimilarity in superior-subordinate
	demographic characteristics, referred to here as "relational demography,"
	is associated with lower effectiveness as perceived by superiors,
	less personal attraction on the part of superiors for subordinates,
	and increased role ambiguity experienced by subordinates. These effects
	were found even after we controlled for the effects of simple demographic
	variables.},

@article{tures:2002,
	Abstract = {The Democratic Peace Proposition, which states that no two democracies
	have ever gone to war with each other, has been questioned by scholars
	who claim that such pacific behavior among free states does not apply
	to lower forms of conflict. In particular, Kegley and Hermann contend
	that democracies intervene in the affairs of other liberal states
	via overt military acts or covert machinations. In many cases, they
	argue that dyadic democratic interventions (DDIs) occur more frequently
	than would be expected given the number of jointly democratic dyads
	in the international system. I examine their research design and
	suggest changes to their concepts of states, interventions, and regime
	type, as well as their sample size and definition of dyads in the
	international system. I implement these changes and retest such arguments
	on a sample of interventions from 1945 to 1991. I find 11 cases where
	a democracy intervenes against another democracy, but these cases
	are rare in comparison to interventions conducted by democratic and/or
	autocratic states in undemocratic states, or by autocratic states
	against democratic states. Furthermore, these DDIs are less likely
	to occur than the presence of democracy in the international system
	would suggest.},

	Abstract = {Several analysts argue that, despite anomalies, the realist paradigm
	is dominant because it is more fertile than its rivals. While the
	ability of the realist paradigm to reformulate its theories in light
	of criticism accounts for its persistence, it is argued that the
	proliferation of emendations exposes a degenerating tendency in the
	paradigm's research program. This article applies Lakatos's criterion
	that a series of related theories must produce problemshifts that
	are progressive rather than degenerating to appraise the adequacy
	of realist-based theories on the balancing of power advanced by neotraditionalists.
	This research program is seen as degenerating because of (1) the
	protean character of its theoretical development, (2) an unwillingness
	to specify what constitutes the true theory, which if falsified would
	lead to a rejection of the paradigm, (3) a continual adoption of
	auxiliary propositions to explain away flaws, and (4) a dearth of
	strong research findings.},

	Abstract = {John Vasquez's assessment of realism suffers from three serious flaws.
	First, his reliance on Imre Lakatos's (1970) model of scientific
	progress is problematic, because the Lakatosian model has been largely
	rejected by contemporary historians and philosophers of science.
	Second, Vasquez understates the range and diversity of the realist
	research program and mistakenly sees disagreements among realists
	as evidence of theoretical degeneration. Finally, he overlooks the
	progressive character of contemporary realist theory, largely because
	he does not consider all the relevant literature. Disagreements within
	and across competing research programs are essential to progress
	and should be welcomed, but Vasquez's effort suggests that criticism
	will be most helpful when it seeks to do more than merely delegitimate
	a particular research tradition.},

	Abstract = {John Vasquez claims to follow Imre Lakatos but distorts his criteria
	for judging theories and evaluating research programs. Vasquez claims
	that facts observed can falsify a theory by showing that its predictions
	are wrong. He fails to consider the puzzles posed by the interdependence
	of theory and fact. He places all realists in a single paradigm despite
	the divergent assumptions of traditional and structural realists.
	In contrast to Vasquez, I argue that explanation, not prediction,
	is the ultimate criterion of good theory, that a theory can be validated
	only by working back and forth between its implications and an uncertain
	state of affairs that we take to be the reality against which theory
	is tested, and that the results of tests are always problematic.},

@article{ward:hoff:2007,
	Abstract = {The authors examine a standard gravity model of international commerce
	augmented to include political as well as institutional influences
	on bilateral trade. Using annual data from 1980-2001, they estimate
	regression coefficients and residual dependencies using a hierarchy
	of models in each year. Rather than gauge the generalizability of
	these patterns via traditional measures of statistical significance
	such as p-values, this article develops and employs a strategy to
	evaluate the out-of-sample predictive strength of various models.
	The analysis of recent international commerce shows that in addition
	to a typical gravity-model specification, political and institutional
	variables are important. The article also demonstrates that the often-reported
	link between international conflict and bilateral trade is elusive,
	and that inclusion of conflict in a trade model can sometimes lead
	to reduced out-of-sample predictive performance. Further, this article
	illustrates that there are substantial, persistent residual exporter-
	and importer-specific effects, and that ignoring such patterns in
	relational trade data results in an incomplete picture of international
	commerce, even in the context of a well-established framework such
	as the gravity model.},

	data taken from the COPDAB data bank. After presenting the static

	powerful nation-states is empirically examined and discussed over
	time (1948-1978) in the separate dimensions of conflict and cooperation,

	to be quite distinct from the ability to use cooperation as a means

	Abstract = {The Rational Design project is impressive on its own terms. However,
	it does not address other approaches relevant to the design of international
	institutions. To facilitate comparison I survey two "contrast spaces"
	around it. The first shares the project's central question-What explains
	institutional design?-but addresses alternative explanations of two
	types: rival explanations and explanations complementary but deeper
	in the causal chain. The second contrast begins with a different
	question: What kind of knowledge is needed to design institutions
	in the real world? Asking this question reveals epistemological differences
	between positive social science and institutional design that can
	be traced to different orientations toward time. Making institutions
	is about the future and has an intrinsic normative element. Explaining
	institutions is about the past and does not necessarily have this
	normative dimension. To avoid "driving with the rearview mirror"
	we need two additional kinds of knowledge beyond that developed in
	this volume, knowledge about institutional effectiveness and knowledge
	about what values to pursue. As such, the problem of institutional
	design is a fruitful site for developing a broader and more practical
	conception of social science that integrates normative and positive
	concerns.},

@article{wendt:1992,
	Abstract = {The claim that international institutions can transform state interests
	is central to neoliberal challenges to the realist assumption that
	"process" (interaction and learning among states) cannot fundamentally
	affect system "structure" (anarchy and the distribution of capabilities).
	Systematic development of this claim, however, has been hampered
	by the neoliberals' commitment to rational choice theory, which treats
	interests as exogenously given and thus offers only a weak form of
	institutional analysis. A growing body of international relations
	scholarship points to ways in which the identities and interests
	of states are socially constructed by knowledgeable practice. This
	article builds a bridge between this scholarship and neoliberalism
	by developing a theory of identity- and interest-formation in support
	of the neoliberal claim that international institutions can transform
	state interests. Its substantive focus is the realist view that anarchies
	are necessarily self-help systems, which justifies disinterest in
	processes of identity- and interest-formation. Self-help is a function
	not of anarchy but of process and, as such, is itself an institution
	that determines the meaning of anarchy and the distribution of power
	for state action. The article concludes with an examination of how
	this institution can be transformed by practices of sovereignty,
	by an evolution of cooperation, and by critical strategic practice.},

	Does mediation in general affect the dynamics and outcomes of crisis
	negotiations? and (2) Does the impact of mediation vary in accordance
	with mediator style? Data are drawn from the International Crisis
	Behavior data set and from ongoing experimental work with human subjects.
	The historical data reveal that mediated crises are more typically
	characterized by compromise among crisis actors, are more likely
	to end in agreements, and show a tendency toward long-term tension
	reduction. The experimental research confirmed the relationship between
	mediation and the achievement of agreement and also revealed that
	mediation leads to crises of shorter duration and to greater satisfaction
	by the parties with the outcome. A manipulative mediation style is
	more likely to yield favorable crisis management outcomes than is
	a more restrictive facilitative style. },

@article{yakubovich:2005,
	Abstract = {In 1973 Granovetter formulated the strength-of-weak-ties hypothesis
	(SWT), which became the foundation of a vast sociological literature
	on social networks in labor markets. Until now, SWT has never been
	directly tested but treated instead as a surrogate for the relationship
	between an actor's network and labor market outcomes such as characteristics
	of a job obtained. The paper restates SWT as a proposition about
	the probability of getting a job as a function of within-actor differences
	in tie strength and tests it with data on hires carried out in one
	Russian city in 1998. In support of SWT, the results show that a
	worker is more likely to get a job through one of her weak ties rather
	than strong ties. The advantages of weak ties lie in their abilities
	to provide timely access to non-redundant information and to influence
	employers directly. In contrast, strong ties are associated with
	indirect influence on employers through well-connected intermediaries.
	The estimates come from a within-worker fixed-effect conditional
	logistic regression and thereby provide rare evidence of an association
	between information and influence transferred through social ties
	and labor market outcomes, independent of workers' individual characteristics.},
