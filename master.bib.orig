	for judging theories and evaluating research programs. Vasquez claims
	that facts observed can falsify a theory by showing that its predictions
	are wrong. He fails to consider the puzzles posed by the interdependence
	of theory and fact. He places all realists in a single paradigm despite
	the divergent assumptions of traditional and structural realists.
	In contrast to Vasquez, I argue that explanation, not prediction,
	is the ultimate criterion of good theory, that a theory can be validated
	only by working back and forth between its implications and an uncertain
	state of affairs that we take to be the reality against which theory
	is tested, and that the results of tests are always problematic.},

	Abstract = {Several analysts argue that, despite anomalies, the realist paradigm
	is dominant because it is more fertile than its rivals. While the
	ability of the realist paradigm to reformulate its theories in light
	of criticism accounts for its persistence, it is argued that the
	proliferation of emendations exposes a degenerating tendency in the
	paradigm's research program. This article applies Lakatos's criterion
	that a series of related theories must produce problemshifts that
	are progressive rather than degenerating to appraise the adequacy
	of realist-based theories on the balancing of power advanced by neotraditionalists.
	This research program is seen as degenerating because of (1) the
	protean character of its theoretical development, (2) an unwillingness
	to specify what constitutes the true theory, which if falsified would
	lead to a rejection of the paradigm, (3) a continual adoption of
	auxiliary propositions to explain away flaws, and (4) a dearth of
	strong research findings.},

	for judging theories and evaluating research programs. Vasquez claims
	that facts observed can falsify a theory by showing that its predictions
	are wrong. He fails to consider the puzzles posed by the interdependence
	of theory and fact. He places all realists in a single paradigm despite
	the divergent assumptions of traditional and structural realists.
	In contrast to Vasquez, I argue that explanation, not prediction,
	is the ultimate criterion of good theory, that a theory can be validated
	only by working back and forth between its implications and an uncertain
	state of affairs that we take to be the reality against which theory
	is tested, and that the results of tests are always problematic.},

	Abstract = {Several analysts argue that, despite anomalies, the realist paradigm
	is dominant because it is more fertile than its rivals. While the
	ability of the realist paradigm to reformulate its theories in light
	of criticism accounts for its persistence, it is argued that the
	proliferation of emendations exposes a degenerating tendency in the
	paradigm's research program. This article applies Lakatos's criterion
	that a series of related theories must produce problemshifts that
	are progressive rather than degenerating to appraise the adequacy
	of realist-based theories on the balancing of power advanced by neotraditionalists.
	This research program is seen as degenerating because of (1) the
	protean character of its theoretical development, (2) an unwillingness
	to specify what constitutes the true theory, which if falsified would
	lead to a rejection of the paradigm, (3) a continual adoption of
	auxiliary propositions to explain away flaws, and (4) a dearth of
	strong research findings.},

	Abstract = {3 possibilities - closed economy, no compensation - open
		  economy, compensation to have coalition for free trade -
		  open economy, no compensation -> authoritarianism
		  
		  two factors determining attitudes of econ actors towards
		  trade: - potential gains of losses from trade - probablity
		  of gains or losses (uncertainty)
		  
		  three actors, one pro free trade (O) , one against (C),
		  one, where his opinion depends on the int. business cycle
		  (P) P is pivotal, can be bought by compensation from P or O
		  
		  AGAIN, Boix does a poor job at interpreting the interaction
		  effect in his model Boix-like empirical analysis, very
		  questionable...
		  
		  OLD Abstract: Simultaneous bargaining game over trade
		  policy and social policy; Close economy, lower social
		  spending, open economy and democracy higher social spending
		  to get losers of open trade policy into the coalition, free
		  trade in dictatorships, no incentives for higher social
		  spending; Preferences determined by to factors, potential
		  benefits from trade, and the probability that gains or
		  losses will be made from trade; Free trade party will offer
		  bigger spending packages than protectionist party because
		  they have to overcome they loss of the pivotal voter ⇒
		  leads to bigger spending in free trade regimes Dictatorship
		  if burden of establishing dictatorship is not exceeding
		  gains from either staying in a closed econ or becoming and
		  open econ, one party has to have larger resources to
		  establish a dictatorship than the other one, also if
		  establishing a dict is cheaper than compensating the
		  pivotal voter Findings: trade grows ⇒ public expenditure

		  strains' that are: (a) high in magnitude, with civilians
		  affected; (b) unjust; and (c) inflicted by significantly
		  more powerful others, including 'complicit' civilians, with
		  whom members of the strained collectivity have weak ties.
		  These collective strains increase the likelihood of
		  terrorism for several reasons, but they do not lead to
		  terrorism in all cases-a range of factors condition their
		  effect.},

	Abstract = {The income tax is arguably one of the most important tax
		  innovations of the past 200 years, only rivalled by the
		  value added tax.
		  
		  Moreover, economic history is littered with examples of
		  early attempts to introduce income taxation that
		  subsequently failed because of the lack of fiscal capacity
		  to extract sufficient yields. Finally, the fact that many
		  countries resorted to temporary taxation of incomes in
		  times of war strongly suggests that fiscal pressures might
		  have played a key role in spreading income taxation during
		  the 19th and early 20th century. p161
		  
		  income tax complicated, trade tax easier to collect p.165
		  
		  we find evidence that reductions in tax collection costs,
		  spending pressures and to a lesser extent social learning
		  played a significant role for the adoption decision. Voting
		  institutions were also important, but in surprising ways.
		  We find evidence that the extension of the franchise at
		  first reduces the likelihood of income taxation. But once
		  the franchise surpasses a threshold (estimated to be around
		  63% of the adult population) the effect reverses and
		  further extension of the franchise makes it more likely
		  that income tax will be levied},

		  assistance in Albania is fairly well targeted to the poor.
		  Moreover, the poverty targeting exceeds that which could be
		  expected on the basis of proxy indicators of targeting

		  unlikely to be obtained on the basis of a questionnaire or

	Abstract = {Terrorism as an act of violence involves a vast and
		  multi-factorial network of sociopolitical causes. Yet this
		  choice of action corresponds to another form of social
		  violence. As psychologists, we can try to explain the
		  consequences of terrorism, the reasons why terrorist groups
		  always seem able to recruit new people for their purpose.
		  It is also, perhaps, the link between these two issues
		  which is even more interesting to explain. This paper
		  offers a short review of past and contemporary hypotheses
		  and research on terrorism in the field of psychology. More
		  generally, this review considers international terrorism
		  mainly perpetrated by radical Islamist fundamentalists. We
		  will focus here on recent studies proposing that identity
		  and, more specifically, social identity could be important
		  factors in terrorism. Within these studies or reports, some
		  point out the importance in contemporary terrorism of the
		  threat that Western countries impute to Muslim and Arab
		  identity As a conclusion, and in line with other authors,
		  we introduce an integrative analysis framework for a

		  true income. This insight leads to a novel approach to
		  estimate tax evasion from privatesector adaptation to
		  semiformality. We use household microdata from a large bank
		  in Greece and replicate bank models of credit capacity,
		  credit card limits, and mortgage payments to infer the
		  bank's estimate of individuals' true income. We estimate a
		  lower bound of 28 billion euros of unreported income for
		  Greece. The foregone government revenues amount to 31
		  percent of the deficit for 2009. Primary taxevading
		  occupations are doctors, engineers, private tutors,
		  accountants, financial service agents, and lawyers. Testing
		  the industry distribution against a number of
		  redistribution and incentive theories, our evidence
		  suggests that industries with low paper trail and
		  industries supported by parliamentarians have more tax
		  evasion. We conclude by commenting on the property right of

@article{azar:1972,
	Abstract = {Over a period of time two nations establish between them
		  an interaction range which they perceive as "normal." This
		  normal relations range (on a scale from very friendly to
		  very hostile) tends to incorporate most of a dyad's
		  interactions and is bound by upper and lower critical
		  thresholds. Conflict escalation is the movement to above
		  the upper critical threshold, and conflict reduction is the
		  return to below that threshold. Using the frequency and
		  intensity of inter-nation events data coded from the 1956
		  Suez crisis (from July 26, 1956, through January 11, 1957)
		  and a thirteen-point scaling instrument, the author shows
		  that during the escalation phase (in comparison with
		  preescalation and with conflict reduction phases)
		  conflicting parties tend to (a) exhibit a symmetrical
		  pattern of hostile interactions and (b) reduce the
		  chronological time intervening between consecutive hostile
		  interactions. Furthermore he shows that during conflict
		  reduction the conflicting parties tend to exhibit (c)
		  asymmetrical hostile interaction patterns and (d) increase
		  the chronological time (or temporal distance) between
		  consecutive hostile events. In an exploratory hypothesis
		  the author suggests that conflicting dyads tend to reduce
		  their hostile interactions to within their normal relations
		  range when (1) they achieve or frustrate their goals, (2)
		  incur heavy costs, or (3) they feel pressured by changes in
		  the domestic and international environments.},

		  power to extract ressources from those who lack it 2. loss
		  of the state over the monopoly of power
		  
		  -distinction to revolution: revolution yields new power
		  oder, state failure leads to chaos
		  
		  -correlation of state failure with civil war: Africa
		  1970-1995: 60% of observations with failed states had civil
		  wars, 70% of observations with civil wars were also failed
		  states
		  
		  - much more known about civil war than about state failure
		  
		  Factors of state failure: 1. economic factors: - poverty -
		  grievance or higher financial incentives for rebellion -
		  fiscal dearth of the gov't - gov't that can't pay their
		  employees (civil servants, military) are worse off -
		  ressource wealth (curse) - seems that only oil wealth
		  matters negatively, but what is the theoretical mechanism,
		  because gov't earn oil revenue not rebells - maybe gov't
		  doesn't care for citizens because tax revenue doesn't
		  matter
		  
		  2. ethnicity - Bates (2008) as well as Fearon & Laition
		  (1996, 2003) find no evidence for the claim that higher
		  ethnic diversity leads to civil war - concentration -
		  probable that curvelinear relationship between size of the
		  largest ethnic group and civil war in Africa - Rule by
		  Minorities - in interaction with ethnic fractionalization
		  and use of fear makes violence more likely
		  
		  3. Democratization - inverted U relationship between regime
		  type and civil war (see Cheibub critique of the democracy

		  romantic and sexual network in a population of over 800
		  adolescents residing in a midsized town in the midwestern
		  United States. Precise images and measures of network
		  structure are derived from reports of relationships that
		  occurred over a period of 18 months between 1993 and 1995.
		  The study offers a comparison of the structural
		  characteristics of the observed network to simulated
		  networks conditioned on the distribution of ties; the
		  observed structure reveals networks characterized by longer
		  contact chains and fewer cycles than expected. This article
		  identifies the micromechanisms that generate networks with
		  structural features similar to the observed network.
		  Implications for disease transmission dynamics and social
		  policy are explored. },

	Abstract = {In this article, we show that de Marchi, Gelpi, and
		  Grynavisk's substantive analyses are fully consistent with
		  our prior theoretical conjecture about international
		  conflict. We note that they also agree with our main
		  methodological point that out-of-sample forecasting
		  performance should be a primary standard used to evaluate
		  international conflict studies. However, we demonstrate
		  that all other methodological conclusions drawn by de
		  Marchi, Gelpi, and Gryanaviski are false. For example, by
		  using the same evaluative criterion for both models, it is
		  easy to see that their claim that properly specified logit
		  models outperform neural network models is incorrect.
		  Finally, we show that flexible neural network models are
		  able to identify important empirical relationships between
		  democracy and conflict that the logit model excludes a
		  priori; this should not be surprising since the logit model
		  is merely a limiting special case of the neural network
		  model.},

@article{bennett:1999,
	Abstract = {Box-Steffensmeier and Jones (1997) provide a good overview
		  of the class of models known as "event history" or
		  "duration" models, but omit some important points about the
		  relationship between duration dependence and time-varying
		  data in parametric models of duration. The key reason to
		  use duration analysis methods is to allow for the
		  possibility of duration dependence in one's data. However,
		  while assumptions about the form of duration dependence
		  appear to be purely methodological, duration dependence can
		  have important substantive implications for theories of
		  politics. There is often an interaction in estimation
		  between duration dependence and covariates. In particular,
		  duration dependence can be revealed or eliminated when
		  particular time-varying variables are included in or
		  removed from a model. This point is especially important
		  because time-varying covariates are more central and common
		  to important research questions than is sometimes realized.
		  Overall, these points lead to the conclusion that findings
		  about duration dependence go hand-in-hand with proper
		  specification and that model specification both in terms of
		  functional form and included variables must be carefully
		  considered before duration methods are applied.},

@article{benson:2004,
	Abstract = {An important question in the conflict processes literature
		  concerns what types of international relationships are more
		  likely to lead to peaceful interactions. Both security and
		  economic ties have been posited as powerful determinants of
		  conflict, yet their effects are often examined
		  independently from one another. Furthermore, a debate
		  exists as to whether it is states' ties to the
		  international order or to each other that are most
		  important in determining conflict. A resolution of the
		  competing perspectives would expect that two states that
		  have a tight network of security and economic
		  relationships, both to each other and to the international
		  order, should be extremely unlikely to engage in hostile
		  action against each other. Surprisingly, a series of
		  multinomial logits using non-directed dyads from 1951 to
		  1985 suggests that dyads with tight economic and security
		  ties at both the state-to-state and state-to-system levels
		  are only slightly less likely to engage in dyadic disputes
		  than those without such simultaneous ties. However, this
		  study finds that both (1) tight security and economic ties
		  to the international order and (2) tight intra-dyadic
		  security and economic ties have important, independent
		  effects in limiting dyadic hostility. This suggests that
		  the states within a dyad have two separate paths to more
		  peaceful interactions - the first lies in tightening ties
		  between states, the second in strengthening dyadic security
		  and economic ties to the international order.},

	Abstract = {The determinants of the welfare state have received a
		  great deal of attention in the comparative political
		  economy literature. An analysis of the role that indirect
		  taxation plays in the politics of advanced industrial
		  societies is, however, missing. This article demonstrates
		  that a full understanding of the links between
		  redistribution, social democracy and corporatism is
		  impossible without a closer look at indirect taxation.
		  Conventional wisdom is questioned and it is shown that
		  social democratic governments in corporatist environments
		  find themselves in a paradoxical situation. They need to
		  support the welfare state by relying upon a fundamentally
		  regressive policy instrument: indirect taxation. It is also
		  shown that social democratic governments can minimize the
		  use of consumption taxes as part of their redistributive
		  strategy only in non-corporatist settings. In exploring
		  these issues, this article illuminates alternative routes
		  for the pursuit of equality in a context of declining
		  corporatist arrangements.},

	Abstract = {Can rational models, once theological explanations are
		  discredited, explain why certain radical religious rebels
		  are so successful in perpetrating suicide attacks? The
		  fundamental barrier to success turns out not to be
		  recruiting suicide attackers; there is a rational basis for
		  volunteering. Rather, the barrier is the danger of other
		  operatives defecting. A club model, portraying voluntary
		  religious organizations as efficient providers of local
		  public goods, explains how they weed out potential
		  defectors by requiring sacrifices as signals of commitment.
		  They are thereby able to succeed in risky terrorist
		  attacks. The model has testable implications for tactic
		  choice and damage achieved by clubs and other rebel
		  organizations. Data spanning a half-century on both
		  terrorists and civil war insurgents, much from Middle East
		  sources and Israel/Palestine, reveal that: a) missions
		  organized by radical religious clubs that provide benign
		  local public goods are both more lethal and are more likely
		  to be suicide attacks than missions organized by other
		  terrorist groups with similar aims and theologies; and b)
		  suicide attacks are chosen when targets are "hard," i.e.,
		  difficult to destroy. Our results suggest benign tactics to
		  counter radical religious terrorism and insurgency. (C)

		  the tax paying population, and discontinuities in the tax

		  selection for continuous-time duration analyses and
		  develops a new estimator to correct for it when necessary.
		  We conduct a series of Monte Carlo analyses that estimate
		  common duration models as well as our proposed duration
		  model with selection. These simulations show that ignoring
		  sample selection issues can lead to biased parameter
		  estimates, including the appearance of (nonexistent)
		  duration dependence. In addition, our proposed estimator is
		  found to be superior in root mean-square error terms when
		  nontrivial amounts of selection are present. Finally, we
		  provide an empirical application of our method by studying
		  whether self-selectivity is a problem for studies of
		  leaders' survival during and following militarized
		  conflicts.},

	Abstract = {A key assumption of nearly all widely used duration models
		  is that the hazard ratios (i.e., the conditional relative
		  risks across substrata) are proportional to one another and
		  that this proportionality is maintained over time.
		  Estimation of proportional hazards models when hazards are
		  non-proportional results in coefficient biases and
		  decreased power of significance tests. Techniques for
		  relaxing this assumption allow scholars to test whether the
		  effects of covariates change over time and also permit a
		  more nuanced understanding of the phenomenon being studied.
		  We address the potential problems with incorrectly assuming
		  proportionality, illustrate a number of tests for
		  non-proportionality, and conclude with a discussion of how
		  to accurately and efficiently estimate these models in the
		  presence of nonproportional hazards. We investigate the
		  proportionality assumption for Cox's semiparametric model
		  in the context of the "liberal peace" debate, using data on
		  international conflict in the postwar period.},

		  repeatability: nearly all political events reoccur, and

		  change all suggest that later events will differ from
		  earlier ones. Yet, most models for event history analysis
		  fail to account for repeated events, a fact that can yield
		  misleading results in practice. We present a class of
		  duration models for analyzing repeated events, discuss
		  their properties and implementation, and offer
		  recommendations for their use by applied researchers. We

		  social capital. I review evidence consistent with the
		  hypothesis, then look at the networks around managers in a
		  large American electronics company. The organization is
		  rife with structural holes, and brokerage has its expected
		  correlates. Compensation, positive performance evaluations,
		  promotions, and good ideas are disproportionately in the
		  hands of people whose networks span structural holes. The
		  between-group brokers are more likely to express ideas,
		  less likely to have ideas dismissed, and more likely to
		  have ideas evaluated as valuable. I close with implications

@article{byman:2006,
	Annote = {Byman discusses the targeted killing of Hamas leader Saleh
		  Shehada and the general Israeli policy of targeted killing.
		  He suggests that Israel's policy has essentially lead to an
		  escalating tit-for-tat interaction as terrorist groups
		  respond to the killings with more suicide attacks. Byman
		  claims that the targeted killings perpetrated by Israel
		  demonstrate that this tactic is less effective on
		  decentralized groups. Thus, terrorist groups in Palestine
		  have adjusted to the attacks by becoming more
		  decentralized. Furthermore, such killings create martyrs,
		  increase legitimacy for the terrorists' cause, and
		  undermine the peace process. However, the policy continues
		  because Israel believes the benefits outweigh the costs:
		  the killings boost public opinion/morale, while retaliatory
		  attacks may occur, attacks over all decrease and the
		  sophistication of these attacks is in decline.
		  
		  Despite any of these advantages, Byman argues, the US
		  should not be quick to adopt the use of targeted killings.
		  Firstly, there is a US ban on assassination that makes this
		  tactic one built on difficult and murky legal territory.
		  Secondly, encouraging the targeted killing of other world
		  leaders only encourages the assassination of our own.
		  Third, because targeted killings are not widely accepted as
		  a ``legitimate instrument of the state'' the US risks its
		  reputation. Lastly, the use of targeted killings is much
		  more difficult for the US because they face a global
		  threat, not one in a neighboring state. In order to use
		  targeted killings as effectively as Israel has the US would
		  need to maintain a huge intelligence presence throughout
		  the Middle East, Central Asia, and Europe.

		  the national economy, presidential incumbency, the state's
		  voting record in the previous two presidential elections,
		  home state and regional advantages for the candidates, the
		  partisan division of the state legislature following the
		  last midterm election, an index of state ideology based on
		  the roll call voting of its House delegation, and five
		  regional trend variables to take into account partisan
		  shifts over time. The equation is estimated over 531 state
		  elections from 1948 to 1988. The overall fit of the
		  equation is quite good. It accounts for nearly 85% of the
		  variance, leaves a standard error of less than four
		  percentage points, and has an average error of just three
		  percentage points of the vote. This level of accuracy is
		  comparable to that of Steven Rosenstone's equation in his
		  Forecasting Presidential Elections (1983). Moreover, the

		  Structural Equation Modeling indicated that exposure to

		  attitudes toward Palestinian citizens of Israel (t3). These

		  expectations. It concludes that an intermediate position on
		  the rationality of terrorism is appropriate. The typical
		  terrorist sympathizer deviates only slightly from homo
		  economicus. But active terrorists arguably stray from
		  narrow self-interest and rational expectations, and
		  suicidal terrorists probably violate both. Deterrence
		  remains a viable anti-terrorism strategy, but deviations

	Abstract = {Many empirical studies have found that disputes over
		  territory are central to the outbreak and intensity of the
		  majority of interstate military conflict. However, the
		  existing literature lacks an explicit theoretical link
		  between the role territory plays in disputes and the
		  outbreak of violence as well as an exploration of how the
		  control of territory is related to conventional military
		  capabilities. This article demonstrates that the targets of
		  territorial claims can consolidate their control over
		  disputed territory to improve their ability to fight
		  effectively on it. The empirical analysis suggests that
		  when territory is strategically located, target states are
		  more likely to consolidate their position, while challenger
		  states are less likely to escalate militarily. Furthermore,
		  when the presence of territorial characteristics such as
		  strategic location makes consolidation an effective
		  strategy, target states are increasingly likely to
		  consolidate as they face stronger opponents.},

		  they use previous administrative frontiers to solve a
		  difficult short-term bargaining problem and a long-term
		  coordination problem. With a unique new set of data
		  collected specifically for this project, we systematically
		  examine the new international borders of the twentieth
		  century resulting from secession, partition, and the use of
		  force. New international borders, we find, are drawn not
		  according to principles of ``nationalism'' or defensible
		  borders, but rather according to previous administrative
		  frontiers. How borders are drawn has important consequences
		  for international stability: borders drawn along previously
		  existing internal or external administrative frontiers
		  experience fewer future territorial disputes and have a
		  much lower risk of militarized confrontation if a dispute

		  Accordingly, states will, from time to time, take assertive
		  measures to secure the border, with among the most
		  aggressive strategies being the construction of physical
		  barriers, which we refer to as ``border walls.'' Using
		  original data on man-made border wall construction from
		  1800 to 2014, we theorize and find that in many cases, wall
		  construction is about economic security. Significant
		  economic disparities between the states will create
		  incentives to illegally transport people or move goods
		  readily available in the poorer country but highly
		  regulated in the richer country. We find that economic
		  disparities have a substantial and significant impact on
		  the presence of a physical wall that is independent of
		  formal border disputes and concerns over instability from
		  civil wars in neighbors. In other words, ``prominent
		  examples such as the Maginot Line'', constructed largely
		  out of fear of attack, is an exception, not the exemplar,
		  of the reasons states construct border walls.},

		  understanding of how the democratic peace unfolds as a
		  historical process in time and space. Whereas most of the
		  conventional literature interprets the phenomenon as a
		  constant and universal law operating at the state level,
		  the author follows Immanuel Kant and treats democratic
		  cooperation as an emergent macroprocess. The current study
		  explores three causal mechanisms. First, strategic tagging
		  introduces a way for democracies to select out like-minded
		  cooperators. Second, regime-sensitive alliances enable
		  democratic states to defend the gains of cooperation.
		  Third, liberal collective security complements the liberal
		  alignments. Based on these processes, it is possible to
		  "grow" cooperative outcomes in an inhospitable geopolitical
		  environment. Because tagging alone is insufficient,
		  alliances, and sometimes even collective security, are
		  necessary to produce perpetual peace. Such outcomes are
		  characterized by high levels of spatial clustering. },

		  predict the onset of a variety of international crises. A
		  quasi-experimental design for studying interrupted time
		  series data is applied to the historical behavior of the
		  Hong Kong and New York financial markets. The results are
		  generally disappointing. These markets seem more likely to
		  react to rather than anticipate crisis developments, and
		  frequently issue "false alarms." Comparison of results for
		  periods where crises took place with those for randomly
		  selected periods where no crisis happened does not engender
		  confidence in markets as crisis predictors. However, there
		  are some notable exceptions to this pessimistic
		  generalization. We conclude that financial indicators may
		  be profitably used in some cases to supplement warning
		  assessments derived from other methods and sources.},

		  corrective to the methodological individualism and

		  structure in global politics. Theoretically, however, the
		  approach remains underspecified. In particular,
		  constructivists typically fail to explain the origins of
		  such structures, how they change over time, how their
		  effects vary cross nationally, or the mechanisms through
		  which they constitute states and individuals. Missing is
		  the substantive theory and attention to agency that will

	Abstract = {How should one measure political regimes?
		  
		  three goals for a measurement of regimes: 1. should serve
		  to address important research questions 2. can be
		  interpreted meaningfully 3. should be reproducible
		  
		  Cheibub and Gandhi propose a sixfold classification of
		  regimes 3 for democracies 3 for autocracies
		  
		  dichotomous meausre of democracy vs. autocracy
		  
		  how to classify regime as dem vs. dict: 1. is the chief
		  exec. elected? 2. is the legisl. elected? 3. is there more
		  than one party competing in elect? 4. alternation in power
		  under the same electoral rule? => important examples Japan
		  and Botswana
		  
		  if ruling party changed, then country a democracy in all
		  these years that were under the same electoral laws as the
		  elections when the change occured
		  
		  other measures: polity VI and Freedom House what is the
		  conception of democracy? minimalistic (DD) or greater
		  minimalist conception good for most theoretical arguments
		  if FH or Polity is used as indep var, one might not know
		  what of the many influencing variables in FH and Polity
		  explains the variance in the dep. var
		  
		  Data: Polity and FH very hard to reproduce, because data
		  very hard to get at not even completely clear where the
		  data comes from and often subjective in coding (FH)
		  
		  Type of measurement: what is it worth to have a scale from
		  with that many points? does it make sense that gov't change
		  from -7 to -5 many of the countries are at the extremes
		  anyways, only the questionable DD cases are in the middle
		  categories that's the reason for the high correlation - but
		  therefore it does still make a difference which measurement
		  is used, because of the middle cases
		  
		  coding of democracies: three types: parliamentary,
		  presidential and mixed democracies
		  
		  1. is there an independently (either directly or
		  indirectly) elected president? 2. is the executive
		  responsible to the leg? 3. Is the gov't responsible to the
		  president - coding done by the rules of the constition not
		  the actual use of the rules
		  
		  Coding of dictatorships:
		  
		  three kinds: monarchy, military dictators, civilian rulers
		  
		  1. who is the effective leader? 2. Does the head of
		  government bear the title of "king" and have a hereditary
		  successor and/or predecessor? 3. Is the head of government
		  a current or past member of the military? if 2 and 3 no
		  then civilian dictator
		  
		  does not make any assumptions about behavior of dictators,
		  can thus be used for theory testing },

	Abstract = {In Perpetual Peace, Immanuel Kant presents six preliminary
		  articles for perpetual peace beforethe three well-known
		  definitive articles about republic constitutions,
		  commercial relations, and international organizations. In
		  his third preliminary article, Kant argues that "Standing
		  Armies (miles perpetuus) Shall in Time be Totally
		  Abolished" because they are themselves "a cause of
		  offensive war." Empirical results based on state-of-the-art
		  data analysis that refers to both peace-years correction
		  and distributed-lags logistic regression showthat the most
		  obvious among the neglected preliminary articles by
		  Kant--military manpower system--is indeed connected to
		  involvement in militarized interstate disputes during the
		  period from 1886 to 1992. For neo-Kantian peace theory and
		  research, this means that a military manpower system with
		  conscripted, notstanding (i.e., professional or voluntary),
		  soldiers is associated with disputes. },

@article{collier:levitsky:1997,
	Abstract = {trade-off between increasing analitical differentiation
		  and conceptual validity
		  
		  two goals: 1. make the structure of conceptual innovation
		  regarding democracy more comprehensible 2. examine
		  trade-offs among these strategies
		  
		  -scholars should be more careful in the definition and use
		  of concepts
		  
		  Satori's strategy: -concept of the ladder, conceptual
		  differentiation by moving down the ladder, generalization
		  moving up, root concept in the middle -but moving up the
		  ladder, to avoid concept stretching leads to a loss of
		  conceptual differentiation
		  
		  Diminished Subtypes: -diminished subtypes not full
		  instances of the root definition -example: limited-suffrage
		  democracy -identifying specific aspects of the root
		  definition that are missing, while the rest is present
		  -diminished subtypes are always related to the root
		  definition
		  
		  Precising the definition of democracy: -can be seen as
		  raising the standard, yet also as adapting the definition
		  to a new context -precising can be useful, but it modifies
		  the definition itself -"definition gerrymandering" - new
		  definition everytime we encounter something unusual
		  
		  Shifting the overarching concept: from regime to democratic
		  government, or democratic state creating additional
		  analytical categories, example: Brazil as a democratic
		  gov't but not a democratic regime or state
		  
		  Conclusion: diminishing subtypes useful for hybrid regimes,
		  but should they be called ...-democracy precising
		  definitions can be helpful, but danger of definition
		  gerrymandering raising standards can allow new analytical
		  issues
		  
		  problem of confusion and miscomunication, also
		  non-comparability of concepts },

@article{cornwell:etal:2008,
	Abstract = {For decades, scholars have wrestled with the assumption
		  that old age is characterized by social isolation. However,
		  there has been no systematic, nationally representative
		  evaluation of this possibility in terms of social network
		  connectedness. In this article, we develop a profile of
		  older adults' social integration with respect to nine
		  dimensions of interpersonal networks and voluntary
		  associations. We use new data from the National Social
		  Life, Health, and Aging Project (NSHAP), a population-based
		  study of non-institutionalized older Americans ages 57 to
		  85, conducted in 2005 to 2006. Results suggest that among
		  older adults, age is negatively related to network size,
		  closeness to network members, and number of
		  non-primary-group ties. On the other hand, age is
		  positively related to frequency of socializing with
		  neighbors, religious participation, and volunteering. In
		  addition, age has a U-shaped relationship with volume of
		  contact with network members. These findings are
		  inconsistent with the view that old age has a universal
		  negative influence on social connectedness. Instead,
		  life-course factors have divergent consequences for
		  different forms of social connectedness. Indeed, some later
		  life transitions, such as retirement and bereavement, may
		  prompt greater connectedness. We conclude by urging
		  increased dialogue between social gerontological and social
		  network research.},

		  physical sanctions against an individual or organization
		  within the territorial jurisdiction of the state"
		  
		  violate "first amendment rights" includes: state as actor,
		  state-sponsored, state-affiliated, violent and non-violent
		  
		  Davenport excludes structural violence, second and third
		  generation rights
		  
		  first repression mostly associated with pol system,
		  recently considering leaders cost/benefit calculation of
		  coercion
		  
		  problems with newspapers as surces: fatigue effect,
		  threshold effect, newshole effect
		  
		  problems with ngo's: often no info about behavior of the
		  citizens
		  
		  asking victims/offenders: how to verify, hard to do across
		  time and space
		  
		  types of datasets: world wide, geographical regions, single
		  countries
		  
		  law of coercive repsonsiveness: if the state is challenged,
		  it will react with some form of repression (conclusive
		  findings) unconclusive findings of the opposite causal
		  direction ==> punishment puzzle
		  
		  1.don't know enough about what constitutes threat to gov'ts
		  to what threats does the state react?
		  
		  2.reaction doesn't have to be violent repression, buy off,
		  propaganda - connect these strings
		  
		  3. why do states still repress even with mixed success,
		  when can dissidents decrease state coercion, when can gov't
		  reduce dissent?
		  
		  Domestic Democratic peace: Dem Inst increase cost of
		  repression core moral values in dem dem provide alternative
		  mechanisms (less conflict)
		  
		  but others disagree - inverted U curve process towards dem
		  increases repression
		  
		  but what is the relationship of democracy and repression
		  and what is it about democracy? executive constraints have
		  pacifying influence
		  
		  whats the theoretical foundation that poor states repress
		  more? trade? influence of FDI? growth?
		  
		  international agreements
		  
		  needs: better theoretical foundation, why does repression
		  take place disaggregation across space and time also

		  2. inverted U - murder in the middle contradictory impulses

	Abstract = {ABSTRACT Beck, King, and Zeng (2000) offer both a sweeping
		  critique of the quantitative security studies field and a
		  bold new direction for future research. Despite important
		  strengths in their work, we take issue with three aspects
		  of their research: (1) the substance of the logit model
		  they compare to their neural network, (2) the standards
		  they use for assessing forecasts, and (3) the theoretical
		  and model-building implications of the nonparametric
		  approach represented by neural networks. We replicate and
		  extend their analysis by estimating a more complete logit
		  model and comparing it both to a neural network and to a
		  linear discriminant analysis. Our work reveals that neural
		  networks do not perform substantially better than either
		  the logit or the linear discriminant estimators. Given this
		  result, we argue that more traditional approaches should be
		  relied upon due to their enhanced ability to test
		  hypotheses.},

		  necessarily apply to terrorist offenders. Subsequently we
		  discuss the assumption of general expertise in mental
		  health professionals in such cases. Furthermore, we

		  evidence. We are particularly concerned about the use of

		  about the approach to be used and the expertise required in

	Abstract = {An analysis of the foreign policies of black African
		  states toward industrialized nations in the middle 1960s is
		  employed in a partial test of a theory of the foreign
		  policies of subordinate states in asymmetrical dyads. In
		  this theory, the interaction of two conditions--the state
		  of a nation's economy and the extent of concentration in
		  its linkages with a superordinate power--is used to explain
		  the foreign policy actions of the subordinate state toward
		  the superordiuate country. Directed dyads are divided into
		  asymmetrical and nonasymmetrical sets, and the hypotheses
		  are tested over both sets via regression analysis. The
		  findings confirm the importance of structural asymmetry as
		  a scope condition on the theory but offer only limited
		  support for the use of the economic strength and linkage
		  concentration variables in the explanation of foreign
		  policy. The results also reveal that the influence of these
		  two variables on foreign policy is not precisely as
		  stipulated by the theory. For the more developed African
		  states, relative economic strength in combination with
		  highly concentrated linkages is associated, contrary to the
		  theory, with a foreign policy of expanded relations with
		  superordinate partners. For the less-developed states, this
		  combination produces a foreign policy designed to restrict
		  relations within the asymmetrical dyad as predicted by the
		  theory.},

	Abstract = {Empirical studies on trade and conflict generally make use
		  of highly aggregated data. There are, however, good
		  theoretical arguments to suspect that trade in some goods
		  should have a bigger impact on the likelihood of conflict
		  than trade in others. This article examines the
		  relationship between trade and conflict at a lower level of
		  aggregation. It discusses various theoretical arguments why
		  the relationship between trade and conflict should vary
		  across industry sectors, particularly strategic trade,
		  asset specificity, and possible appropriation of gains from
		  trade. The central hypotheses are tested using dyadic
		  United Nations trade data disaggregated at industry level
		  from 1970 to 1997. The main findings are that trade
		  generally reduces the likelihood of conflict, the
		  relationship is weaker for commodities that are more easily
		  appropriable by force, and the relationship is generally
		  stronger for manufactured goods with the notable exceptions
		  of chemical and metal industries and the high-technology
		  sector. },

	Abstract = {International peacebuilding can improve the prospects that
		  a civil war will be resolved. Although peacebuilding
		  strategies must be designed to address particular
		  conflicts, broad parameters that fit most conflicts can be
		  identified. Strategies should address the local roots of
		  hostility, the local capacities for change, and the (net)
		  specific degree of international commitment available to
		  assist sustainable peace. One can conceive of these as the
		  three dimensions of a triangle whose area is the "political
		  space"-or effective capacity-for building peace. We test
		  these propositions with an extensive data set of 124
		  post-World War II civil wars and find that multilateral,
		  United Nations peace operations make a positive difference.
		  UN peacekeeping is positively correlated with
		  democratization processes after civil war, and multilateral
		  enforcement operations are usually successful in ending the
		  violence. Our study provides broad guidelines for designing
		  the appropriate peacebuilding strategy, given the mix of
		  hostility, local capacities, and international
		  capacities.},

		  polities in which two, and only two, distinct communities
		  dominate the political arena. The concept of a bicommunal
		  polity is analytical rather than statistical. Permanent
		  asymmetry characterizing the two components makes a simple
		  majoritarian formula for decisionmaking processes
		  unacceptable. What other decisional frameworks have a
		  greater chance for success: federalism, federalism with a
		  heavy dose of confederal ingredients, regional
		  confederation, consociationalism or secession? A confederal
		  modification of federalism has so far appeared as more
		  acceptable to two asymmetric and antagonistic polities than
		  a concept of a federal union with ts commitment to an
		  overarching cultural-political national union. The high
		  failure rate of bicommunal configurations points also to
		  the necessity to relate the inner working of bicommunal
		  polities to international balancing processes and/or
		  support or abstinence of "blood-related" nation-states.},

	Abstract = {Using time-series procedures, the authors investigate
		  whether transnational terrorism changed following 9/11 and
		  the subsequent U.S.-led "war on terror." Perhaps
		  surprising, little has changed in the time series of
		  overall incidents and most of its component series. When
		  9/11 is prejudged as a break date, the authors find that
		  logistically complex hostage-taking events have fallen as a
		  proportion of all events, while logistically simple, but
		  deadly, bombings have increased as a proportion of deadly
		  incidents. These results hold when they apply the
		  Bai-Perron procedure in which structural breaks are data
		  identified. This procedure locates earlier breaks in the
		  mid-1970s and 1990s. Reasonable out-of-sample forecasts are
		  possible if structural breaks are incorporated fairly
		  rapidly into the model.},

	Abstract = {Conventional wisdom holds that in international disputes,
		  a state's military threats are more likely to work the more
		  the state is favored by the balance of power or the balance
		  of interests. Analysis of a game-theoretic model of crisis
		  signaling substantially refines and revises this claim. Due
		  to selection effects arising from strategic behavior,
		  measures of the relative strength of a defender's interests
		  that are available before a crisis begins (ex ante) should
		  be related to the failure of the defender's threats during
		  the crisis. Ex ante measures of the defender's relative
		  military strength should correlate with the success of the
		  defender's crisis threats, but due to strategic dynamics
		  that are not grasped by the standard arguments. A
		  reanalysis of Huth and Russett's data on immediate
		  deterrent threats lends support for these and other
		  hypotheses drawn from the game-theoretic treatment.},

	Abstract = {Realist and other scholars commonly hold that rationally
		  led states can and sometimes do fight when no peaceful
		  bargains exist that both would prefer to war. Against this
		  view, I show that under very broad conditions there will
		  exist negotiated settlements that genuinely rational states
		  would mutually prefer to a risky and costly fight. Popular
		  rationalist and realist explanations for war fail either to
		  address or to explain adequately what would prevent leaders
		  from locating a less costly bargain. Essentially just two
		  mechanisms can resolve this puzzle on strictly rationalist
		  terms. The first turns on the fact that states have both
		  private information about capabilities and resolve and the
		  incentive to misrepresent it. The second turns on the fact
		  that in specific strategic contexts states may be unable
		  credibly to commit to uphold a mutually preferable bargain.
		  Historical examples suggest that both mechanisms are
		  empirically plausible.},

	Abstract = {It is common for scholars interested in race and poverty
		  to invoke a lack of access to job networks as one of the
		  reasons that African Americans and Hispanics face
		  difficulties in the labor market. Much research has found,
		  however, that minorities do worse when they use personal
		  networks in job finding. Research in this area has been
		  hampered by the complicated and multi-step nature of the
		  job-finding process and by the lack of appropriate
		  comparison data for demonstrating the various ways in which
		  minorities can be isolated from good job opportunities. We
		  seek to specify what it means to say that minorities are
		  cut off from job networks. Building on the literature on
		  social networks in the labor market, we delineate the
		  various mechanisms by which minorities can be isolated from
		  good job opportunities. We examine how these mechanisms
		  operate, using unique data on the chain of network contacts
		  that funnel to an employer offering desirable jobs. We find
		  that network factors operate at several stages of the
		  recruitment process. We find scant evidence, however, that
		  these network factors serve to cut off minorities from
		  employment in this setting. We conclude with a discussion
		  of the theoretical and methodological implications of the
		  case for the study of networks, race, and hiring.},

	Abstract = {Norms have never been absent from the study of
		  international politics, but the sweeping "ideational turn"
		  in the 1980s and 1990s brought them back as a central
		  theoretical concern in the field. Much theorizing about
		  norms has focused on how they create social structure,
		  standards of appropriateness, and stability in
		  international politics. Recent empirical research on norms,
		  in contrast, has examined their role in creating political
		  change, but change processes have been less well-theorized.
		  We induce from this research a variety of theoretical
		  arguments and testable hypotheses about the role of norms
		  in political change. We argue that norms evolve in a
		  three-stage "life cycle" of emergence, "norm cascades," and
		  internalization, and that each stage is governed by
		  different motives, mechanisms, and behavioral logics. We
		  also highlight the rational and strategic nature of many
		  social construction processes and argue that theoretical
		  progress will only be made by placing attention on the
		  connections between norms and rationality rather than by
		  opposing the two.},

	Abstract = {Contemporary analyses of international relations
		  forecasting contain conceptual and epistemological errors.
		  Alternative definitions of forecasting are contradictory;
		  programs for developing scientific forecasts of
		  international phenomena fail to acknowledge important
		  epistemological difficulties. Forecasting and prediction
		  are distinguished, and several illustrations of each type
		  of activity are presented. Criteria for determining the
		  soundness of scientific forecasts then are offered, and the
		  prospects for constructing sound international relations
		  forecasts are assessed. The primary conclusion is that
		  individual-level generalizations of events like crises have
		  the greatest potential in this regard. Forecasts of
		  systems-transformation, in contrast, will never be
		  scientifically sound; generalizations of this kind offer
		  the least potential for developing scientifically
		  meaningful forecasts.},

	Abstract = {This article tests the hypotheses that interstate war is
		  more probable (a) between nation-states of approximately
		  equal national power (power parity) and (b) between
		  geographically proximate nation-states. The data base
		  consists of thirty dyadic interstate wars during the period
		  1816-1965. The analysis employs four indicators of national
		  power: geographical area, population, fuel consumption, and
		  steel production. Hypotheses are tested using the
		  Kolmogorov-Smirnov one-sample test. The proximity
		  hypothesis is confirmed (p&lt;.01). The power parity
		  hypothesis is partially confirmed; except for the steel
		  production analysis, all results are in the predicted
		  direction. The population hypothesis is confirmed
		  (p&lt;.025), and there is considerable support for the
		  geographical area hypothesis (p&lt;.10). The findings
		  justify further dyadic and nondyadic analyses and an effort
		  to develop a power parity theory of interstate war.},

	Abstract = {The relationship between static and dynamic power
		  distributions and war is a central element in the realist
		  literature of international politics. The distribution of
		  power and shifts in these distributions are held to be a
		  principal source of conflict in works from Thucydides to
		  Waltz. Most attempts to test empirically for a structural
		  association between capability distributions and conflict
		  have treated disputes as independent events; however, over
		  the last two centuries a disproportionate amount of
		  interstate conflict has occurred in the context of extended
		  dyadic rivalries. This study focuses on the conflict
		  patterns of these "enduring rivals." Based on a Markov
		  chain analysis of 456 militarized disputes occurring
		  between 1816 and 1986, the findings indicate that power
		  parity and shifts toward parity are approximately twice as
		  likely to be associated with war as is a condition of power
		  preponderance. By definition, rival dyads have issues in
		  conflict. Equality of power or shifts toward equality
		  create a situation in which both sides can perceive the
		  potential for successful use of force. The findings
		  generated in this analysis indicate that with such power
		  distributions war between rival nations is most probable.},

	Abstract = {Otherwise powerful, formidable democracies are tempting
		  targets for international violence because they have
		  leaders who, on average, have been in office for shorter
		  periods of time than leaders of autocracies. Domestic
		  incentives may make resistance more costly than offering
		  concessions for inexperienced leaders of both democratic
		  and authoritarian states. Over time, however, resistance
		  may become domestically less costly, causing experienced
		  leaders to be more likely to prefer resistance.
		  Anticipating this response, potential challengers may be
		  more likely to target inexperienced leaders. Because
		  democracies generally have high rates of leadership
		  turnover, they are tempting targets for international
		  violence. Statistical analysis of crisis initiation between
		  1918 and 1992 confirms the perception that democracies are
		  more likely to be targets of militarized challenges.
		  Results are also consistent with the proposition that the
		  relatively short tenure in office served by democratic
		  leaders helps to account for the observed pattern of
		  democratic attraction of foreign challenges. },

	Abstract = {AbstractThe devastating civil war that began in Syria in
		  March 2011 is the result of complex interrelated factors.
		  The focus of the conflict is regime change, but the
		  triggers include a broad set of religious and
		  sociopolitical factors, the erosion of the economic health
		  of the country, a wave of political reform sweeping over
		  the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) and Levant region,
		  and challenges associated with climate variability and
		  change and the availability and use of freshwater. As
		  described here, water and climatic conditions have played a
		  direct role in the deterioration of Syria?s economic
		  conditions. There is a long history of conflicts over water
		  in these regions because of the natural water scarcity, the
		  early development of irrigated agriculture, and complex
		  religious and ethnic diversity. In recent years, there has
		  been an increase in incidences of water-related violence
		  around the world at the subnational level attributable to
		  the role that water plays in development disputes and
		  economic activities. Because conflicts are rarely, if ever,
		  attributable to single causes, conflict analysis and
		  concomitant efforts at reducing the risks of conflict must
		  consider a multitude of complex relationships and
		  contributing factors. This paper assesses the complicated
		  connections between water and conflict in Syria, looks more
		  broadly at future climate-related risks for water systems,
		  and offers some water management strategies for reducing
		  those risks.},

		  retrospective data, the paper first assesses friendship
		  homophily over the four years of college. Friendship is
		  homophilous across gender and race. QAP regression is used
		  to determine the impact of both preference and propinquity
		  (measured by participation in joint extra-curricular

		  While preference predicts friendship choice in the freshman
		  year, propinquity remains the strongest determinant of

	Abstract = {International relations theorists disagree about whether
		  great power behaviors reflect bureaucratic routine or
		  reciprocity. Recently, some have suggested that these
		  behaviors result from great powers' rational expectations
		  rather than from simple routine or reciprocity. The debate
		  is flawed in several respects. The quasi-experimental
		  studies of great power behavior suffer from specification
		  and measurement errors. Furthermore, most studies of great
		  power behavior focus exclusively on the superpowers,
		  without adequately appreciating China's role in world
		  politics. We present an improved analysis that recognizes
		  the potential effects of Chinese behavior and ameliorates
		  the methodological flaws in existing work. The results
		  indicate that the behaviors of the United States, the
		  Soviet Union, and China are a relatively stable mix of
		  bureaucratic routine and reciprocity. The results also
		  indicate complex, asymmetrical connections among
		  U.S.-Soviet, U.S.-Chinese, and Soviet-Chinese relations,
		  consistent with the notion of a strategic triangle.},

@article{gourevitch:1978,
	Abstract = {The international system is not only an expression of
		  domestic structures, but a cause of them. Two schools of
		  analysis exploring the impact of the international system
		  upon domestic politics (regime types, institutions,
		  coalitions, policies) may be distinguished: those which
		  stress the international economy, and those which stress
		  political-military rivalry, or war. Among the former are
		  such arguments as: late industrialization (associated with
		  Gershenkron); dependencia or core-periphery arguments
		  (Wallerstein); liberal development model (much American
		  writing in the 50s and 60s); transnational
		  relation-modernization (Nye, Keohane, Morse);
		  neo-mercantilists (Gilpin); state-centered Marxists
		  (Schurmann). Arguments stressing the role of war include
		  those which focus on the organizational requirements of
		  providing security (Hintze, Anderson), the special nature
		  of foreign relations (classical political theory),
		  territorial compensation (diplomatic history), and strains
		  of foreign involvement (analysis of revolutions). These
		  arguments provide the basis for criticism of much of the
		  literature which uses domestic structure as an explanation
		  of foreign policy, in particular those which (such as the
		  strong-state weak-state distinction) tend, by excessive
		  focus on forms, to obscure the connection between
		  structures and interests, and the role of politics. These
		  arguments also permit criticism of the notion of a recent
		  fundamental discontinuity in the nature of international
		  relations.},

	Abstract = {This paper asks (a) why and how institutions change, (b)
		  how an institution persists in a changing environment, and
		  (c) how processes that it unleashes lead to its own demise.
		  The paper shows that the game-theoretic notion of
		  self-enforcing equilibrium and the historical
		  institutionalist focus on process are both inadequate to
		  answer these questions. Building on a game-theoretic
		  foundation, but responding to the critique of it by
		  historical institutionalists, the paper introduces the
		  concepts of quasi-parameters and self reinforcement. With
		  these concepts, and building on repeated game theory, a
		  dynamic approach to institutions is offered, one that can
		  account for endogenous change (and stability) of
		  institutions. Contextual accounts of formal governing
		  institutions in early modern Europe and the informal
		  institution of cleavage structure in the contemporary world
		  provide illustrations of the approach.},

		  friendship networks condition the association between
		  friends' delinquency and an individual's own delinquent
		  behavior. Data from the Add Health allows a more accurate
		  conceptualization of the peer network and a more rigorous
		  measurement of peer delinquency than previous research.
		  Findings from this study indicate that friends' delinquency
		  is associated with an adolescent's own delinquency
		  involvement. However, characteristics of adolescents'
		  friendship networks, such as its density and adolescents'
		  centrality and popularity, condition the delinquency-peer
		  association. Network density, in particular, emerges as an
		  important component of the delinquency-peer association,
		  with very cohesive networks containing stronger
		  delinquency-peer associations than those that are less
		  cohesive. These findings suggest that it is necessary to
		  consider the underlying structural properties of friendship
		  networks in order to understand the impact of peer
		  influence on adolescent delinquency. },

		  The relationship between the different conceptions of

		  few civil wars, and intermediate regimes are the most

		  democracy or greater autocracy. Is the greater violence of
		  intermediate regimes equivalent to the finding that states
		  in political transition experience more violence? If both
		  level of democracy and political change are relevant, to
		  what extent is civil violence related to each? Based on an
		  analysis of the period 1816-1992, we conclude that
		  intermediate regimes are most prone to civil war, even when
		  they have had time to stabilize from a regime change. In
		  the long run, since intermediate regimes are less stable
		  than autocracies, which in turn are less stable than
		  democracies, durable democracy is the most probable
		  end-point of the democratization process. The democratic
		  civil peace is not only more just than the autocratic peace
		  but also more stable.},

	Abstract = {In the literature on civil war onset, several empirical
		  results are not robust or replicable across studies.
		  Studies use different definitions of civil war and analyze
		  different time periods, so readers cannot easily determine
		  if differences in empirical results are due to those
		  factors or if most empirical results are just not robust.
		  The authors apply a methodology for organized specification
		  tests to check the robustness of empirical results. They
		  isolate causes of variation in empirical results by using
		  the same definition of civil war and analyzing the same
		  time period while systematically exploring the sensitivity
		  of eighty-eight variables used to explain civil war in the
		  literature. Several relationships with the onset of civil
		  wars prove robust: large population and low income levels,
		  low rates of economic growth, recent political instability
		  and inconsistent democratic institutions, small military
		  establishments and rough terrain, and war-prone and
		  undemocratic neighbors. Variables representing ethnic
		  difference in the population are robust only in relation to
		  lower level armed conflict.},

	Abstract = {Recent research on representational linkages between
		  legislators and their constituents challenges the
		  long-standing assumption that constituency preferences are
		  exogenous to the linkage process, but does not clearly
		  suggest the conditions under which a specific pattern of
		  linkage should exist. Drawing on a diverse collection of
		  prior research, we argue that issues that function as main
		  lines of cleavage between competing political parties
		  should be characterized by reciprocal linkages between mass
		  and elite preferences, while highly complex issues on which
		  party distinctions are unclear should be characterized by
		  no linkages between mass and elite. For salient issues on
		  which the public fails to distinguish party positions, we
		  expect the traditional one-way linkage from mass to elite.
		  We test our theoretical expectations with a unique version
		  of the data from the 1958 American Representation Study-and
		  with explicit predictions for which policy issues addressed
		  in that study should demonstrate which particular pattern
		  of mass-elite linkage. The empirical results, derived from
		  LISREL analyses for three policy areas, are entirely in
		  accord with our predictions.},

	Abstract = {Domestic political conflict has been a constant companion
		  to international trade, but the nature of that conflict has
		  varied greatly in Western democracies over the last two
		  centuries. Political battles over trade policy appear to
		  have sometimes divided societies along broad class lines
		  and at other times split them into narrow industry-based
		  coalitions. I argue that this diversity stems from
		  historical and cross-national variation in inter-industry
		  factor mobility. Class coalitions are more likely where
		  factor mobility is high, whereas narrow, industry-based
		  coalitions are more likely where mobility is low. Evidence
		  from six Western economies for the last two centuries
		  indicates that levels of factor mobility have varied
		  historically and cross-nationally in accord with
		  industrialization and regulation. This variation
		  corresponds broadly with observable differences in the
		  formation of trade policy coalitions.},

	Abstract = {Applications of modern methods for analyzing data with
		  missing values, based primarily on multiple imputation,
		  have in the last half-decade become common in American
		  politics and political behavior. Scholars in these fields
		  have thus increasingly avoided the biases and
		  inefficiencies caused by ad hoc methods like listwise
		  deletion and best guess imputation. However, researchers in
		  much of comparative politics and international relations,
		  and others with similar data, have been unable to do the
		  same because the best available imputation methods work
		  poorly with the time-series cross-section data structures
		  common in these fields. We attempt to rectify this
		  situation. First, we build a multiple imputation model that
		  allows smooth time trends, shifts across cross-sectional
		  units, and correlations over time and space, resulting in
		  far more accurate imputations. Second, we build
		  nonignorable missingness models by enabling analysts to
		  incorporate knowledge from area studies experts via priors
		  on individual missing cell values, rather than on
		  difficult-to-interpret model parameters. Third, since these
		  tasks could not be accomplished within existing imputation
		  algorithms, in that they cannot handle as many variables as
		  needed even in the simpler cross-sectional data for which
		  they were designed, we also develop a new algorithm that
		  substantially expands the range of computationally feasible
		  data types and sizes for which multiple imputation can be
		  used. These developments also made it possible to implement
		  the methods introduced here in freely available open source
		  software that is considerably more reliable than existing
		  strategies.},

		  status contexts often encourage participation among higher
		  status individuals at the same time that they discourage
		  participation among lower status individuals. As a result,
		  political activity is more highly structured by individual

		  international law in the resolution of territorial disputes
		  from 1945 to 2000. In doing so, we focus on three outcomes
		  of interest. First, when do states choose to revise the
		  territorial status quo through negotiations instead of
		  force? Second, when are states able to reach a final
		  settlement? Third, when do states prefer a process of legal
		  dispute resolution (i.e., adjudication or arbitration) to
		  bilateral negotiations? To answer these questions, we argue
		  that when the legal principles relevant to the dispute are
		  unambiguous and clearly favor one side, a law-based focal
		  point will emerge. This focal point, in turn, facilitates
		  the settlement process by helping leaders overcome
		  distribution problems, a central obstacle in reaching a
		  final agreement. We find strong and consistent empirical
		  support for our hypotheses regarding international law and
		  peaceful dispute resolution.},

		  assassination of a head of state specifically affects
		  political stability through an analysis of all
		  assassinations of heads of state between 1952 and 1997. The
		  authors theorize that the resulting levels of instability
		  following an assassination are conditional on the type of
		  state institutions preexisting the assassination event.
		  They find that those states, which lack a regularized means
		  of leadership succession, experience higher levels of
		  instability following an assassination attack. Conversely,
		  states that have preexisting, regularized mechanisms for
		  leadership, levels of instability following an attack
		  actually decline.
		  
		  Insight for our paper---what kind of leadership replacement
		  system do insurgent groups have? If they have a high number
		  of recruits, and leaders are easily/swiftly replaced in an
		  organized and streamlined manner, then the implication that
		  would follow from findings about states is that insurgent
		  networks are immune to these attacks.

		  less redistribution, due to more center-right governments;

	Abstract = {The motor of international politics has been war among the
		  leading states. The most developed states in the
		  international system-the United States, Western Europe, and
		  Japan-form what Karl Deutsch called a security community,
		  which is a group of countries among which war is
		  unthinkable. These states are the most powerful ones in the
		  world and, so, are traditional rivals. Thus the change is
		  striking and consequential Constructivists explain this in
		  terms of changed ideas and identities; liberals point to
		  democracy and economic interest; realists stress the role
		  of nuclear weapons and American hegemony. My own
		  explanation combines the high cost of war, the gains from
		  peace, and the values that are prevalent within the
		  security community. Whatever the cause, the existence of
		  the community will bring with it major changes in
		  international politics and calls into question many
		  traditional theories of war.},

Jordan investigates the effectiveness of leadership decapitation on terrorist groups by assessing the duration of the organization and its tactical capacity following an attack. Using an original data set (1945-2000) Jordan uses measures of group size, age, and organization type as her independent variables and argues that ideological organizations are weaker following decapitation than are religious ones, and younger and smaller organizations are more likely to cease activity following the targeted killing of leader (she measures her DV, effectiveness, in two ways: firstly by group collapse/lifespan and secondly the group's capacity to carry out future attacks following the decapitation). She claims that leadership decapitation is an ineffective counterterrorism strategy because it does not increase the likelihood of the group's collapse. -Can't specifically at whether number of members increases (back lash recruitment) -Predicts individual head leader matters more than upper echelon members. But does quantity matter? Does she account for variation in number of leaders killed?},

	Abstract = {This article discusses how endogenous mechanisms linking
		  processes of violent conflict and the economic well-being
		  of individuals and households in combat areas provide
		  valuable micro foundations to the ongoing debate on the
		  causes and duration of armed conflict. Notably, the
		  endogenous relationship between conflict processes and
		  household economic status leads to the emergence of
		  symbiotic associations between armed groups and households
		  living in areas they control that affect substantially the
		  probability of a conflict starting and its effectiveness
		  thereafter. Households in conflict areas draw on local
		  armed groups to protect their economic status when
		  anticipating violence and during the conflict, while armed
		  groups make use of different levels of (either reluctant or
		  voluntary) participation, support and cooperation from
		  local populations to advance their strategic objectives at
		  the onset and throughout the conflict. The level of
		  household participation at the start and during the
		  conflict is a function of two interdependent variables,
		  namely household vulnerability to poverty and household
		  vulnerability to violence. The poorer the household is at
		  the start of the conflict, the higher is the probability of
		  the household participating and supporting an armed group.
		  The higher the risk of violence, the higher is the
		  probability of the household participating and supporting
		  armed groups. The interaction between these two variables
		  varies with the conflict itself and is defined by the
		  direct and indirect effects of conflict-induced violence on
		  the economic behaviour and decisions of households in
		  combat areas.},

		  have focused attention primarily on changes in the
		  international system. This paper attempts to show that
		  foreign economic policy can be understood only if domestic
		  factors are systematically included in the analysis. The
		  paper's first part groups the recent literature into three
		  paradigms which distinguish between three international
		  effects. The second part offers a comparison of the
		  differences between a state-centered policy network in
		  France and a society-centered network in the United States.
		  The third part of the paper combines the arguments of the
		  first two and analyzes French and American commercial,
		  financial, and energy policies as the outcome of both
		  international effects and domestic structures. These case
		  studies show that domestic factors must be included in an
		  analysis of foreign economic policies. The paper's main
		  results are analyzed further in its fourth part.},

		  -definition of democracy should be procedural and should
		  not include outcomes
		  
		  -multidimensional because there are different features of
		  democracy that don't necessarily come together
		  
		  1. elections (DD) 2. limitations on government 3.
		  individual rights
		  
		  all are necessary conditions for gov't not sufficient
		  
		  elections are most important to democracy, use of DD as
		  concept
		  
		  why limitations? 1. limitations of gov't most often preceed
		  democracy 2. limitation assure that no election will be the
		  last, winner of election must follow rules using POLCON III
		  (veto players) measure for concept continuous between 0 and
		  1
		  
		  individual rights: -freedom of thought, speech, and
		  assembly make electoral competition meaningful Freedom
		  House Civil Liberty indicator
		  
		  other poles: authoritarianism opposite pole of democracy is
		  dictatorship, but implies single-dimension, we have three

	Abstract = {This article offers the first independent scholarly
		  evaluation of the claims, forecasts, and causal inferences
		  of the State Failure Task Force and its efforts to forecast
		  when states will fail. State failure refers to the collapse
		  of the authority of the central government to impose order,
		  as in civil wars, revolutionary wars, genocides,
		  politicides, and adverse or disruptive regime transitions.
		  States that sponsor terrorism or allow it to be organized
		  within their borders are all failed states. This task
		  force, set up at the behest of Vice President Gore in 1994,
		  has been led by a group of distinguished academics working
		  as consultants to the U.S. CIA. State Failure Task Force
		  reports and publications have received attention in the
		  media, in academia, and from public decision makers. The
		  article identifies several methodological errors in the
		  task force work that cause its reported forecast
		  probabilities of conflict to be too large, its causal
		  inferences to be biased in unpredictable directions, and
		  its claims of forecasting performance to be exaggerated.
		  However, the article also finds that the task force has
		  amassed the best and most carefully collected data on state
		  failure to date, and the required corrections provided in
		  this article, although very large in effect, are easy to
		  implement. The article also demonstrates how to improve
		  forecasting performance to levels significantly greater
		  than even corrected versions of its models. Although the
		  matter is still a highly uncertain endeavor, the authors
		  are nevertheless able to offer the first accurate forecasts
		  of state failure, along with procedures and results that
		  may be of practical use in informing foreign policy
		  decision making. The article also describes a number of
		  strong empirical regularities that may help in ascertaining
		  the causes of state failure.},

	Abstract = {We examine whether the conditions affecting initial
		  expressions of hostility are similar to those affecting
		  militarized disputes. Analyzing dyadic interactions during
		  the years 1951-1992, we estimate a model to take into
		  account selection effects and check it against another
		  allowing conjunctive causation. Both provide close
		  approximations to theoretical models of the conflict
		  process and yield similar results. We confirm Kant's belief
		  that all states are subject to the realist conditions of
		  interstate competition that makes disputes likely, but that
		  liberal influences, if present, can constrain the
		  escalation of such disputes to war. Several influences on
		  the conflict process have nonmonotonic effects over the
		  range of state behavior. Geopolitical factors affect the
		  opportunity for conflict more at lower levels of the
		  conflict process, when less information is available
		  regarding acceptable settlements and actors' resolve, than
		  at higher levels. Factors affecting willingness gain
		  importance as the conflict process unfolds because they
		  facilitate the flow of information relevant to the ongoing
		  dispute. The proposition that democracy and interdependence
		  encourage diplomatic conflicts as signals of resolve is not
		  supported.},

	Abstract = {Over the past ten years or so there has been renewed
		  research interest in the relative impact of peer selection
		  and peer influence on the increasing similarity of
		  teenagers in their substance use. Researchers have
		  concluded that either peer selection or peer influence
		  explained the similarity. This paper examines this research
		  question differently using complete network data and

		  similarity in the substance use of teenagers and their
		  peers is explained by either peer selection or peer
		  influence for some, by both peer selection and peer
		  influence for others, and by neither for others. Using a
		  sociological approach and a social network perspective this
		  paper demonstrates how chain reactions result in similarity
		  in the substance use of teenagers in their peer groups, by
		  drawing together those who are similar with those who are
		  not. The paper demonstrates how chain reactions involve
		  peer selection, the patterning of peer ties and peer
		  influence, and explores how gender affects all aspects of

	Abstract = {Electoral institutions influence legislators' constituency
		  size and makeup and, as a result, affect the lens that
		  representatives look through to assess the costs of
		  military conflict. Given the uneven distribution of
		  casualties during a conflict, the costs of international
		  violence vary between constituencies and thus affect
		  representatives differently. The authors develop a
		  constituency-based theory of legislator accountability and
		  legislature behavior that predicts when democracies are
		  willing to pay human costs in an interstate conflict and
		  their likelihood of being involved in a dispute. The
		  results suggest that the more diffuse political
		  account-ability, the less likely a state is to get involved
		  in a militarized dispute, but that once involved, the more
		  likely a state will sustain casualties. The authors'theory
		  suggests that choices over the mechanisms of political
		  representation have far-reaching effects on political
		  accountability and foreign policy. },

	Abstract = {A unique longitudinal and prospective approach is used to
		  analyze the social embeddedness of rural-urban Thai
		  migrants and their subsequent migration. More than any one
		  particular social tie, it is the configuration of social
		  ties at multiple levels that influences whether migrants
		  experience their destination as integrative and a place for
		  settlement or not. Social ties at multiple levels and from
		  multiple sources weave into a social fabric that surrounds
		  migrants in destination contexts, shaping their migration
		  trajectories. The findings show that urban-integrated
		  migrants with diverse social support ties in the urban
		  destination who reside in village enclaves and households
		  that promote social adaptation and incorporation tend to be
		  found again in urban destinations 6 years later. By
		  comparison, semi-integrated and urban-isolated migrants
		  whose social support ties, community structures, and
		  households provide relatively weak links and support within
		  the urban setting exhibit stronger tendencies to return to
		  their villages of origin or to migrate onward from their
		  initial destination. The findings suggest that migrants'
		  mobility pathways-whether they settle in their current
		  destination, return to their villages of origin, or make
		  additional movements onward-depend on the organization of

	Abstract = {The structure of international trade, identified by the
		  degree of openness for the movement of goods, can best be
		  explained by a state-power theory of international
		  political economy. This theory begins with the assumption
		  that the nature of international economic movements is
		  determined by states acting to maximize national goals.
		  Four goals--aggregate national income, political power,
		  social stability, and economic growth--can be
		  systematically related to the degree of openness in the
		  international trading system for states of different
		  relative sizes and levels of development. This analysis
		  leads to the conclusion that openness is most likely to
		  exist when there is a hegemonic distribution of potential
		  economic power. Time-series data on tariff levels, trade
		  proportions, regional concentration, per capita income,
		  national income, share of world trade, and share of world
		  investment are then presented. The first three are used to
		  describe the degree of openness in the trading system; the
		  last four, the distribution of state power. The data
		  suggest that the state-power theory should be amended to
		  take into consideration domestic political constraints on

@article{krause:1997,
	Abstract = {Theory: It is argued here that previous studies analyzing
		  the formation of voters' economic expectations overlook
		  important subtleties found in a differentiated
		  (heterogeneous) electorate. Since different segments of the
		  electorate possess varying information capabilities, it is
		  asserted that they will form their prospective economic
		  evaluations differently from one another. Hypotheses: The
		  impact of "expectational" electoral cycles, news coverage
		  of the economy reported by voters, retrospective economic
		  evaluations, and personal financial expectations are
		  hypothesized to have a differential impact on their
		  economic expectations based on varying levels of
		  information (education) among subsets of the electorate.
		  Methods: Time series multiple regression analysis is
		  conducted for the monthly period between January 1978 and
		  December 1990. The empirical analysis involves testing for
		  the properties of the statistical time series (i.e.,
		  integration and cointegration) as well as specification of
		  an error correction mechanism (ECM) that captures long-run
		  statistical relationships in appropriate circumstances.
		  Results: These findings uncover electoral heterogeneity
		  (based on information/education differences) with respect
		  to voters' prospective economic evaluations. Specifically,
		  the information capabilities of voters is inversely related
		  to their reliance on past/retrospective sources of
		  information when forming both egocentric and sociotropic
		  economic expectations. The main implication of this
		  research is that the assumption of electoral homogeneity
		  contained in previous longitudinal analyses of aggregate
		  economic opinion formation provides misleading results that
		  either overlook intra-electoral variations, introduce
		  aggregation bias, or possibly both.},

		  data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent

		  suggest that athletic involvement fails to inhibit male

		  wrestlers, as opposed to baseball, basketball, tennis, and
		  other athletes, are significantly more likely than
		  nonathletic males to be involved in a serious fight.
		  Additionally, the direct effect of football is explained by
		  the football participation of individuals' peers. Males
		  whose friends play football are more likely to fight than
		  other males, supporting perspectives that emphasize peer
		  contexts as important mediators. Overall, findings are

		  distinguished, approaching it as a "syndrome'' and as a

		  terrorism represents a psychologically meaningful construct
		  with identifiable characteristics on individual and group
		  levels of analysis. According to the "tool'' perspective,
		  terrorism represents a strategic instrument that any party
		  in a conflict with another may use. Research thus far has
		  found little support for the "syndrome'' view. Terrorists
		  do not seem to be characterized by a unique set of
		  psychological traits or pathologies. Nor has research
		  uncovered any particular "root causes'' of terrorism. The
		  vast heterogeneity of terrorism's users is consistent with
		  the "tool'' view, affording an analysis of terrorism in
		  terms of means-ends psychology. The "tool'' view implies
		  conditions under which potential perpetrators may find
		  terrorism more or less appealing, hence offering guidance
		  for the "war on terrorism.''},

	Abstract = {Social science research on terrorism has grown rapidly in
		  recent years, aided by social and legal studies. In this
		  review, we examine research oil the causes of terrorism and
		  the effectiveness of strategies for countering it. We
		  define terrorism as the threatened or actual use of illegal
		  force directed against civilian targets by nonstate actors
		  in order to attain a political goal through fear, coercion,
		  or intimidation. Our review of causes is divided by level
		  of analysis into sections on individual-, group-, and
		  macro-level explanations. Our evaluation of
		  counterterrorism strategies includes reviews of legal,
		  criminal justice, military, and legitimacy campaigns.
		  Psychopathological approaches have been largely
		  discredited; however, evidence suggests that certain
		  experiences, attitudes, and behaviors are overrepresented
		  among terrorists. The potential impact of ideology,
		  leadership, Popular support, Diasporic communities, and
		  socialization on group dynamics all provide fertile areas
		  for additional research. Terrorism feeds on the ability of
		  groups to portray governments and their agents as
		  illegitimate. There is also evidence for high rates of
		  terrorism in countries that are in democratic transition or
		  are described as failed state!;. Research on connections
		  between religious motives and terrorism is mixed. Although
		  research on the efficacy of counterterrorism methods has
		  grown rapidly in recent)fears, it is still rarely evaluated
		  with strong empirical methods. All of these conclusions are
		  qualified by the fact that both individual- and group-level
		  empirical data on terrorism are in short supply.},

		  hypotheses: democracies are more likely to ally with each
		  other, and states of any similar regime type are more
		  likely to ally with each other. These hypotheses emerge
		  from three theories: constructivism, economic
		  interdependence, and credible commitments. The authors use
		  a data set of all pairs of states from 1816 to 1992.
		  Results show that states with similar regime type are more
		  likely to ally with each other after 1945, although two
		  democracies are not more likely to ally than two
		  autocracies during this period, and distance, learning,
		  threat, and common culture affect alliance behavior, but
		  trade does not. Results indicate sharp limits to the
		  connection between democracy and international cooperation.

	Abstract = { ABSTRACT Currency crises are costly phenomena that have
		  been exceptionally difficult to explain and predict. We
		  comprehensively examine the relationship between political
		  institutions and currency crises and emphasize the causal
		  linkage between institutions, expectations, and crises.
		  Specifically, we argue that institutional
		  variables&mdash;particularly divided government and
		  government turnover&mdash;increase the variance of
		  expectations held by speculators thereby increasing the
		  likelihood of currency crises. We test these hypotheses
		  using three existing economic models of currency crises and
		  find that institutional variables are not only
		  statistically significant, but also substantially improve
		  the ability of these models to forecast crises.We are
		  grateful to Helen Milner, Charles Cameron, William
		  Bernhard, and seminar participants at the University of
		  Wisconsin and the University of Southern California for
		  helpful comments. Lisa Martin and our referees provided
		  feedback that helped dramatically improve our arguments and
		  exposition. Andy Rose, Steve Kamin, Mathieu Bussiere, and
		  Marcel Fratzscher generously provided data and advice that

		  states including at least one major power. They are argued
		  to be the population of dyads at risk of international
		  conflict and are increasingly commonly used as the cases
		  analyzed by conflict researchers. Does reliance on relevant
		  dyads (a nonrandom sample of all dyads) introduce threats
		  to valid inference? The authors argue that relevant dyad
		  usage might introduce related problems of measurement error
		  and selection bias and investigate whether there is
		  evidence of such potential problems existing in actual
		  relevant dyad data sets. Results show evidence for both
		  types of potential problems, but neither problem
		  substantively affects estimates of conflict relationships.
		  Therefore, relevant dyad usage is not especially
		  objectionable due to either of these problems, and
		  retrospective sampling might be an even more profitable
		  course for future research. },

		  problem of predicting state public expenditures in four
		  major categories: human services, elementary and secondary
		  education, higher education, and health services. Demand
		  functions for public services are derived within a formal
		  utility-maximizing model. The resulting model is estimated
		  using time-series data for a representative state and the
		  model is used to predict state spending for fiscal year
		  1985. The results of the estimation are consistent with the
		  predictions of the median voter model and the forecasts
		  correspond closely to those made by the State Bureau of the
		  Budget. In contrast, a naive autoregressive model of state
		  spending performs poorly.},

		  prospect theory to our understanding of international
		  relations. I begin with the implications of loss aversion,
		  the endowment effect, risk orientation, and framing for
		  theoretical questions relating to the stability of the
		  status quo in international politics, deterrence,
		  bargaining, and preventive war. I then raise conceptual and
		  methodological problems which complicate the theoretical
		  and empirical application of prospect theory to
		  international behavior. I illustrate my arguments with
		  references to some recent attempts to use a prospect theory
		  framework to guide case studies of crises decision-making.
		  I conclude that in applying prospect theory to empirical
		  cases, the analyst must demonstrate not only that empirical
		  behavior is consistent with the theory but also that the
		  observed behavior cannot adequately be explained by a
		  rational choice model which posits the maximization of
		  expected value.},

		  the election actually occurs. After comparing the
		  performance of several naive bivariate models based on
		  economic performance, international involvement, political
		  experience, and presidential popularity, we go on to
		  formulate a multivariate model. This economy-popularity
		  regression model rather accurately forecasts the winner 6
		  months in advance of the election, by employing spring
		  measures of presidential popularity and the growth rate in
		  real GNP per capita. Furthermore, the model's performance,
		  both ex post facto and prior to the election, compares
		  favorably with the Gallup final preelection poll taken only
		  a few days before the election.},

		  six months prior to the election, plus the time of the
		  election (midterm or not). This model is more attractive
		  than the earlier, strictly midterm, models propounded by
		  Tufte and Hibbs. It is clearly superior in forecasting the
		  1982 results. In general, the model's forecasts for postwar
		  House races are very close to the actual result, off only
		  five or six seats at the median, regardless of whether the
		  forecast is made ex post or ex ante. As a final exercise,
		  we apply the model to 1984, in order to forecast the

		  this paper, we begin to characterize the stationary
		  distributions of iterative imputations and their
		  statistical properties, accounting for the conditional
		  models being iteratively estimated from data rather than
		  being prespecified. When the families of conditional models
		  are compatible, we provide sufficient conditions under
		  which the imputation distribution converges in total
		  variation to the posterior distribution of a Bayesian
		  model. When the conditional models are incompatible but
		  valid, we show that the combined imputation estimator is

@article{lizardo:2006,
	Abstract = {This article examines the relationship between different
		  forms of cultural taste and the density of social contacts
		  across alternative types of network relations classified by
		  average tie strength. The author builds on Bourdieu's
		  ([1986] 2001) classic statement on the "forms of capital"
		  (economic, social, and cultural) and the conversion
		  dynamics among them, and on DiMaggio's (1987) connection
		  between cultural tastes and sociability. He hypothesizes
		  that (1) in addition to cultural tastes being determined by
		  network relations, cultural tastes are used to form and
		  sustain those networks. Furthermore he expects that (2)
		  highbrow culture taste will be less likely to be converted
		  into social capital beyond immediate strong-tie circles due
		  to its more restricted, "asset-specific" nature. Because of
		  its generalized appeal, taste for popular culture will be
		  more likely to be associated with weak-tie network density.
		  The results broadly support these hypotheses: a model that
		  specifies an effect of culture on network density provides
		  a better fit to the data than the traditional conception of
		  networks as determining taste. In addition using log-linear
		  models and instrumental-variable methods, I show that
		  popular culture consumption has a positive impact on
		  weak-tie network density but not strong-tie network
		  density, while highbrow culture consumption selectively
		  increases strong-tie density but has no appreciable effect
		  on weak ties, net of standard socioeconomic variables.
		  These findings help to shed light on the mechanisms that
		  translate mastery of different types of cultural knowledge
		  into integration across distant social positions or closure
		  around strong group boundaries. The author also discusses
		  the implications of the results for current models
		  describing the transformation of cultural into social
		  resources.},

	Abstract = {The aim of this paper is to understand the interrelations
		  among relations within concrete social groups. Social
		  structure is sought, not ideal types, although the latter
		  are relevant to interrelations among relations. From a
		  detailed social network, patterns of global relations can
		  be extracted, within which classes of equivalently
		  positioned individuals are delineated. The global patterns
		  are derived algebraically through a 'functorial' mapping of
		  the original pattern. Such a mapping (essentially a
		  generalized homomorphism) allows systematically for
		  concatenation of effects through the network. The notion of
		  functorial mapping is of central importance in the 'theory
		  of categories,' a branch of modem algebra with numerous
		  applications to algebra, topology, logic. The paper
		  contains analyses of two social networks, exemplifying this
		  approach. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

	Abstract = {Does a state's use of indiscriminate violence incite
		  insurgent attacks? To date, most existing theories and
		  empirical studies have concluded that such violence is
		  highly counterproductive because it creates new grievances
		  while forcing victims to seek security, if not safety, in
		  rebel arms. This proposition is tested using Russian
		  artillery fire in Chechnya (2000 to 2005) to estimate
		  indiscriminate violence's effect on subsequent patterns of
		  insurgent attacks across matched pairs of similar shelled
		  and nonshelled villages. The findings are counterintuitive.
		  Shelled villages experience a 24 percent reduction in
		  posttreatment mean insurgent attacks relative to control
		  villages. In addition, commonly cited "triggers" for
		  insurgent retaliation, including the lethality and
		  destructiveness of indiscriminate violence, are either
		  negatively correlated with insurgent attacks or
		  statistically insignificant.},

		  economies, throughout history existing claims have been
		  frequently overturned by revolutions. One unsettled
		  question is whether income inequality affects the
		  likelihood of revolt. This paper takes an approach
		  different from previous studies by introducing data derived
		  from two surveys of revolutionary preferences across a
		  quarter-million randomly sampled individuals. More people
		  are found to have a preference for revolt when inequality
		  in their nation is high. A 1-standard-deviation increase in
		  the Gini coefficient explains up to 38 percent of the
		  standard deviation in revolutionary support. The results
		  hold after controlling for a set of personal
		  characteristics and country and year fixed effects. Since
		  higher levels of income are found to have a negative impact
		  on the taste for revolt, the results suggest that either
		  "going for growth" or implementing policies that reduce
		  inequality can buy off those individuals with revolutionary
		  preferences.},

		  that our conclusion depends on the preferences of the

		  Dai fails to accurately replicate our model, and hence
		  erroneously claims that the new equilibria she deduces are
		  consistent with it. In addition, we demonstrate that in
		  altering one of our assumptions, Dai offers a model that is
		  less realistic as well as inconsistent with the substantive
		  literature on international bargaining. Finally, we
		  question the robustness of her approach. Due to these
		  problems of replication, realism, and robustness, we
		  conclude that Dai's model is of limited utility.},

	Abstract = {The concept of international affinity--albeit under
		  different names--captures a central place in international
		  relations research. This study examines how different types
		  of affinity affect the likelihood of conflict between
		  states. The authors discuss different types of affinities
		  as these appear in the realist and liberal paradigms. They
		  offer a social networks conception of structural
		  affinity--the concept of structural equivalence--which
		  reflects the similarity of international ties across a set
		  of different networks. They test the hypotheses derived
		  from these paradigms, using both existing measures of
		  affinity and their own structural equivalence measures.
		  Their findings suggest that (1) strategic affinity has a
		  consistent dampening effect on the probability of dyadic
		  conflict, (2) trade-related affinity does consistently
		  affect the probability of dyadic conflict, and (3)
		  intergovernmental organization-related affinity has a
		  negative impact on conflict, mostly in the twentieth
		  century. },

		  theoretical developments in other fields of political
		  science, but lacking an overarching analytical framework
		  they failed to produce a coherent body of scholarship.
		  Current efforts to reinvigorate the study of international
		  institutions draw on a new body of theory about domestic
		  institutions. We argue that the assumptions of this new
		  approach to institutions are more appropriate to
		  international studies than those of earlier attempts to
		  transfer theories across levels of analysis. We suggest
		  that the most productive questions for future research will
		  focus on specifying alternative mechanisms by which
		  institutions can influence outcomes and identify particular
		  sets of questions within this agenda that are especially
		  promising.},

	Abstract = {Have the core discussion networks of Americans changed in
		  the past two decades? In 1985, the General Social Survey
		  (GSS) collected the first nationally representative data on
		  the confidants with whom Americans discuss important
		  matters. In the 2004 GSS the authors replicated those
		  questions to assess social change in core network
		  structures. Discussion networks are smaller in 2004 than in
		  1985. The number of people saying there is no one with whom
		  they discuss important matters nearly tripled. The mean
		  network size decreases by about a third (one confidant),
		  from 2.94 in 1985 to 2.08 in 2004. The modal respondent now
		  reports having no confidant; the modal respondent in 1985
		  had three confidants. Both kin and non-kin confidants were
		  lost in the past two decades, but the greater decrease of
		  non-kin ties leads to more confidant networks centered on
		  spouses and parents, with fewer contacts through voluntary
		  associations and neighborhoods. Most people have densely
		  interconnected confidants similar to them. Some changes
		  reflect the changing demographics of the U.S. population.
		  Educational heterogeneity of social ties has decreased,
		  racial heterogeneity has increased. The data may
		  overestimate the number of social isolates, but these
		  shrinking networks reflect an important social change in
		  America},

	Abstract = {The ubiquitous yet inaccurate belief in international
		  relations scholarship that cognitive biases and emotion
		  cause only mistakes distorts the field's understanding of
		  the relationship between rationality and psychology in
		  three ways. If psychology explains only mistakes (or
		  deviations from rationality), then (1) rationality must be
		  free of psychology; (2) psychological explanations require
		  rational baselines; and (3) psychology cannot explain
		  accurate judgments. This view of the relationship between
		  rationality and psychology is coherent and logical, but
		  wrong. Although undermining one of these three beliefs is
		  sufficient to undermine the others, I address each
		  belief-or myth-in turn. The point is not that psychological
		  models should replace rational models, but that no single
		  approach has a lock on understanding rationality. In some
		  important contexts (such as in strategic choice) or when
		  using certain concepts (such as trust, identity, justice,
		  or reputation), an explicitly psychological approach to
		  rationality may beat a rationalist one.},

		  volunteers in which, as a result of an endogenous choice,
		  individuals with low ability or little education are most
		  likely to volunteer to join the terrorist organization.
		  However, the terrorist organization screens the volunteers
		  for quality. Consequently, the model is consistent with two
		  seemingly contradictory empirical findings. Actual
		  terrorist operatives are not poor or lacking in education.
		  And yet lack of economic opportunity and recessionary
		  economies are positively correlated with terrorism. The
		  model also endogenizes the effect of government
		  counterterrorism on mobilization. Government crackdowns
		  have competing effects on mobilization: they decrease the
		  ability of terrorists to carry out effective attacks
		  (making mobilization less attractive), and they foment
		  ideological opposition to the government and impose
		  negative economic externalities (making mobilization more
		  attractive). This provides conditions under which
		  government crackdowns increase or decrease mobilization.},

	Abstract = {Poliheuristic theory (PH) bridges the gap between
		  cognitive and rational theories of decision making. PH
		  postulates a two-stage decision process. During the first
		  stage, the set of possible options is reduced by applying a
		  "noncompensatory principle" to eliminate any alternative
		  with an unacceptable return on a critical, typically
		  political, decision dimension. Once the choice set has been
		  reduced to alternatives that are acceptable to the decision
		  maker, the process moves to a second stage, during which
		  the decision maker uses more analytic processing in an
		  attempt to minimize risks and maximize benefits. In this
		  article, the author applies poliheuristic theory to
		  individual, sequential, and interactive decision settings.
		  Subsequent articles in this issue offer theoretical
		  extensions and multiple tests of the theory using multiple
		  methods (formal, statistical, experimental).},

	Abstract = {Economic and organizational sociologists have increasingly
		  demonstrated that the actions of individuals and firms are
		  affected by the social networks within which they are
		  embedded. In recent years scholars have begun to recognize
		  that the effects of these social networks may vary across
		  populations or types of relations. This article examines
		  the extent to which the effects of interfirm networks on
		  the behavior of firms are historically contingent. Focusing
		  on the level of debt financing among approximately 140
		  large U.S. corporations over a 22-year period, the authors
		  show that the extent to which the firms'use of debt was
		  influenced by those with which they were tied through
		  director interlocks declined over time. The authors argue
		  that this decline in the network effect reflected a shift
		  in the institutional environment within which the firms
		  operated, and that it was driven by three processes: the
		  professionalization of the finance function within the
		  firm, the internalization of financial decision-making, and
		  the increased volatility of the environment. They conclude
		  that corporate financing is socially embedded, but this
		  embeddedness is historically contingent.},

	Abstract = {Suicide missions made their modern debut in 1981. In
		  recent years, however, they have witnessed an unprecedented
		  increase according to several indicators, including number
		  of attacks, number of organizations conducting these
		  attacks, number of countries targeted, and number of
		  victims. Existing explanations, including the occupation
		  and outbidding theses, cannot account for the dramatic
		  increase and spread of suicide attacks. A combination of
		  quantitative and qualitative methods, including analysis of
		  a data set of 1,857 suicide attacks from December 1981
		  through March 2008, suggests that two interrelated factors
		  have contributed to the "globalization of martyrdom":
		  al-Qaida's evolution into a global terrorist actor and the
		  growing appeal of its guiding ideology, Salafi jihad. As
		  localized patterns of suicide missions have given way to
		  more globalized patterns, states must rethink their
		  counterterrorism strategies. At the same time, because
		  Salafi. jihadist groups tend to target Muslims, moderate
		  Muslims and nonviolent Salafists must take the lead in

	Abstract = {Has sociology become more socially integrated over the
		  last 30 years? Recent work in the sociology of knowledge
		  demonstrates a direct linkage between social interaction
		  patterns and the structure of ideas, suggesting that
		  scientific collaboration networks affect scientific
		  practice. I test three competing models for sociological
		  collaboration networks and find that a structurally
		  cohesive core that has been growing steadily since the
		  early 1960s characterizes the discipline's coauthorship
		  network. The results show that participation in the
		  sociology collaboration network depends on research
		  specialty and that quantitative work is more likely to be
		  coauthored than non-quantitative work. However, structural
		  embeddedness within the network core given collaboration is
		  largely unrelated to specialty area. This pattern is
		  consistent with a loosely overlapping specialty structure
		  that has potentially integrative implications for
		  theoretical development in sociology.},

	Abstract = {A model is introduced that yields a single parsimonious
		  explanation for a diverse range of political phenomena,
		  including the processes of democratic consolidation and
		  peace among democratic nations. The model predicts
		  democratic values to arise from the norms of contract that
		  are endemic in developed market economies and yields the
		  novel contingent claim that the peace among democratic
		  nations may be a pattern limited to those democracies with
		  developed economies. Analyses of a large number of
		  interstate dyads from 1950 to 1992 show strong support for
		  this hypothesis. It seems that the pacifying impact of
		  democracy is about twice as strong among developed
		  countries compared with other dyads. Among conflict-prone
		  contiguous dyads, the pacifying impact of democracy does
		  not appear statistically significant among the poorest
		  decile of joint democratic dyads. The study demonstrates
		  the wide explanatory power of the simple postulate that
		  social values and political preferences derive from
		  socioeconomic norms. },

		  document that the opposite holds for political
		  mobilization. Citizens are more likely to participate in
		  elections if they belong to large groups. We present
		  evidence that both the absolute size of groups and their
		  population share influence individual participation
		  decisions. The link between group size and political
		  mobilization is in part due to the structure of media
		  markets. Candidates find it easier to direct campaign

		  state strength literature to identify relevant country
		  macrostructural factors that can contribute to different
		  kinds and levels of intensity of conflict and country
		  instabilities. A pattern classification algorithm-fuzzy
		  analysis of statistical evidence (FASE)-is used to analyze
		  the relationships between country macrostructural factors
		  and historical instances of country instability. A
		  split-sample validation design is used to evaluate the
		  ability of FASE to generate competent predictions, using
		  the standard forecasting performance metrics overall
		  accuracy, recall, and precision. The results demonstrate
		  the potential for FASE to accurately forecast not just the
		  occurrence but also the level of intensity of
		  country-specific instabilities out 5 years with about 80%
		  overall accuracy.},

		  generally, the processes of invention the authors discover
		  there are transposition, refunctionality, and catalysis
		  across multiple social networks. Specifically, political
		  co-optation of cambio bankers in the aftermath of the
		  Ciompi revolt induced the transposition of domestic guild
		  methods to the international plane, thereby changing their
		  purpose and their reach. Subsequent social absorption
		  through marriage of these elevated bankers into the
		  victorious political alliance infused partnership with the
		  multiplex logic (and often money) of dowry, thereby
		  reproducing partnership systems as an integral component in
		  post-Ciompi republicanism. Medieval organizational logics
		  of patrilineage and guild were transformed into Renaissance
		  organizational logics of marriage and clientage. The
		  origins of financial capitalism are partly rooted in this

		  problem of separating the effects of homophily and

		  substance-use behaviour exhibit the homophily principle.
		  Adolescents who adapt their substance use behaviour to
		  match that of their friends display the assimilation
		  principle. We use the Siena software to illustrate the
		  co-evolution of friendship networks, smoking, cannabis use
		  and drinking among sport-active teenagers. Results indicate
		  strong network selection effects occurring with a
		  preference for same sex reciprocated relationships in
		  closed networks. Assimilation occurs among cannabis and
		  alcohol but not tobacco users. Homophily prevails among
		  tobacco and alcohol users. Cannabis use influences smoking
		  behavior positively (i.e., increasing cannabis increases
		  smoking). Weaker effects include drinkers smoking more and
		  cannabis users drinking more. Homophily and assimilation
		  are not significant mechanisms with regard to sporting
		  activity for any substance. There is, however, a
		  significant reduction of sporting activity among smokers.
		  Also, girls engaged in less sport than boys. Some
		  recommendations for health promotion programmes are made.},

		  such standard approaches by taking account of the reasoning
		  of the terrorist-organization leader as well as the
		  reasoning of the individual terrorist. This allows us to
		  observe the influence of the leader on the individual
		  terrorist. Furthermore, we distinguish different motives
		  that influence the individual agents activities. More
		  precisely, we consider terrorist support as an impure
		  public good generating different characteristics. Moreover,
		  we allow the leader to influence the individual terrorists
		  activities via different technologies; and finally, we take
		  account of the fact that individual terrorists may develop
		  a strong feeling of belongingness to the organization. In
		  our framework, it is possible to explain why rational
		  terrorists support terrorism and even commit suicide
		  attacks. In line with empirical findings, income levels
		  play no decisive factor in terrorists readiness to commit

		  neglect of parameter slope heterogeneity. Based on this
		  discussion, we suggest substantial changes of the

		  preferred methodological stance, we demonstrate that
		  Garrett and Mitchell's findings are not robust. Instead, we

	Abstract = {This paper suggests a three-stage procedure for the
		  estimation of time-invariant and rarely changing variables
		  in panel data models with unit effects. The first stage of
		  the proposed estimator runs a fixed-effects model to obtain
		  the unit effects, the second stage breaks down the unit
		  effects into a part explained by the time-invariant and/or
		  rarely changing variables and an error term, and the third
		  stage reestimates the first stage by pooled OLS (with or
		  without autocorrelation correction and with or without
		  panel-corrected SEs) including the time-invariant variables
		  plus the error term of stage 2, which then accounts for the
		  unexplained part of the unit effects. We use Monte Carlo
		  simulations to compare the finite sample properties of our
		  estimator to the finite sample properties of competing
		  estimators. In doing so, we demonstrate that our proposed
		  technique provides the most reliable estimates under a wide
		  variety of specifications common to real world data. },

	Abstract = {This paper reviews current understandings of the
		  psychology of suicide terrorism for psychiatrists and other
		  mental health professionals to help them better understand
		  this terrifying phenomenon. After discussing key concepts
		  and definitions, the paper reviews both group and
		  individual models for explaining the development of suicide
		  terrorists, with an emphasis on "collective identity."
		  Stressing the importance of social psychology, it
		  emphasizes the "normality" and absence of individual
		  psychopathology of the suicide bombers. It will discuss the
		  broad range of terrorisms, but will particularly emphasize
		  terrorism associated with militant Islam. The article
		  emphasizes that comprehending suicide terrorism requires a
		  multidisciplinary approach that includes anthropological,
		  economic, historical, and political factors as well as
		  psychological ones. The paper concludes with a discussion
		  of implications for research, policy, and prevention,
		  reviewing the manner in which social psychiatric knowledge
		  and understandings applied to this phenomenon in an
		  interdisciplinary framework can assist in developing
		  approaches to counter this deadly strategy.},

		  progressivity of the tax structure in the USA and Europe.
		  LIS data allow a comparison of tax rates that attempts to
		  take different starting rates, thresholds and exemptions
		  into account. Our study supports the argument others have
		  made that the USA has more progressive taxes than the
		  European countries. However, we find that Britain's tax
		  structure is more regressive than those of the continental
		  welfare states, making the mapping of tax structure onto
		  the three worlds of welfare' imperfect. We also show that
		  it is a mistake to assume that income and property taxes
		  are always progressive: regressive examples of both are
		  common in the data. But sales taxes are regressive wherever
		  they are found, and we suggest that the proportion of tax
		  revenue raised through sales taxes can serve as an index of
		  overall progressivity in situations where the detailed data
		  examined here are not available. We close by outlining
		  several possible explanations for the inverse correlation
		  between tax progressivity and welfare state effort. },

		  generating new norms in world politics has been documented
		  by scholars, but the literature has focused predominantly
		  on nonsecurity ("new") issue areas. Conversely, although
		  recent constructivist work in international relations has
		  examined the security policies of states, typically it is
		  the state that is doing the constrncting of interests. I
		  bridge these two literatures by examining the hard case of
		  transnational civil society working through issue networks
		  to teach state interests in security policy. I analyze the
		  campaign by transnational civil society to generate an
		  international norm prohibiting antipersonnel land mines and
		  trace the effects of several techniques through which
		  states can be said to be socialized. Through generating
		  issues, networking, "grafting," and using a transnational
		  Socratic method to reverse burdens of proof, the campaign
		  has stimulated systemic normative change through two
		  processes: norm adoption through the conversion of
		  persuaded moral entrepreneurs and emulation resulting from

		  "governments typically seek IMF programs when they need a

		  Governments with high deficits enter into IMF arrangements
		  to have fiscal discipline imposed upon them. They are
		  likely to pursue this strategy when the costs of rejecting
		  the IMF are high --- when they are sensitive to decisions
		  of creditors and investors --- provided sovereignty costs
		  are low. The Fund cares about the absolute size of a
		  balance of payments deficit. Beyond this, it seeks to
		  maximize its budget by signing as many countries as its

@article{ramirez:boli:1987,
	Abstract = {We show that in some cases, a military defeat or a failure
		  to keep pace with industrial development in rival countries
		  stimulated the state to turn to education as a means of
		  national revitalization to avoid losing power and prestige
		  in the interstate system. In other cases, when a nation
		  moving toward a position of first rank in the system was
		  challenged by rivals attempting to block its rise through
		  military alliances and economic exertions, mass schooling
		  was adopted as a means of achieving more comprehensive
		  mobilization to assure continued success in the system.
		  External challenges of these sorts were important stimuli
		  to state action in education, not least because they
		  exacerbated the costs associated with internal obstacles to
		  national development and success, including such factors as
		  the power of the clergy, state- or class-based privileges,
		  and subunit political autonomy
		  
		  earliest regulation proclaiming universal compulsary
		  education appeared in the German state of Weimar in 1619,
		  
		  PRUSSIA: problem of prussia to create a nation to go along
		  with its state,
		  
		  the institutionalization, however followed a victory in the
		  war against Austria and France, no national polity, 40
		  years later loss to Napoleon France, "Conditions were ripe
		  for Fichte's words to have effect. Almost immediately, a
		  Bureau of Education was established within the Ministry of
		  the Interior; ten years later, a separate Department of
		  Education was created in the Ministry of Religion,
		  Education, and Public Health. Between 1817 and 1825, under
		  the direction of Baron von Altenstein, state administration
		  of education was established (Rowlinson 1974). Taxes were
		  imposed to finance the school system, and every Land was
		  required to establish local primary and folk schools. State
		  certification of primary school teachers and the
		  establishment of state normal schools to provide teacher
		  training followed later (Reisner 1922)."
		  
		  "First, the state attempted to use mass schooling to create
		  a more unified national citizenry and thereby consolidate
		  state power both within the nation and relative to other
		  national states, as enunciated explicitly by Fichte.
		  Second, the union was sparked by a clear challenge to
		  Prussia's position in the European state system- its defeat
		  at the hands of the French after a period during which
		  Prussia had managed gradually to increase its international
		  stature and power. Prussia saw its rise in the European
		  system blocked. Its response was state-controlled
		  education, and the system it constructed would later be
		  widely cited as an important element of Prussian (German)
		  success in the state system."
		  
		  AUSTRIA: some starts, but hindered by loss to france,
		  reactionary forces, full focus on state led edu system
		  triggered by the defeat at the hands of Prussia in 1866,
		  
		  DENMARK after loss of state power, education as
		  strengthening of the state
		  
		  SWEDEN: "The ensuing upheaval resulted in a new
		  constitution, and further turmoil and uncertainty led the
		  Swedes to invite Jean Bernadotte, one of Napoleon's
		  generals, to take the throne in 1810. At the same time,
		  bourgeois liberals led a movement to develop mass schooling
		  to provide national unity and purpose. Their efforts were
		  defeated by the reactionary politics of the aristocracy,
		  clergy, and new king and by the unwillingness of the
		  peasantry to foot the bill for an educational system
		  (Jansson 1948)."
		  
		  FRANCE: education under ancien regime, mostly religious
		  schools, education only to the upper middle class, poor
		  were left to philantrophy, Napolean: "Of all political
		  questions, that [of education] is perhaps the most
		  important. There cannot be a firmly established political
		  state unless there is a teaching body with definitely
		  recognized princi- ples. If the child is not taught from
		  infancy that he ought to be a republican or a monarchist, a
		  Catholic or a free-thinker, the state will not constitute a
		  nation; it will rest on uncertain and shifting foundations;
		  and it will be constantly exposed to disorder and change.
		  (Quoted in Reisner 1922, p. 35)" but no real change to
		  increased public education until after the loss in the
		  Franco-Prussian war in 1870, "one popular expression
		  current in France at the time was that the Franco-Prussian
		  War had been "won by the Prussian schoolmaster""
		  
		  ENGLAND: "But events in the 1860s altered the situation.
		  First, further political reform began to enfranchise the
		  working classes (1867), and a new Liberal- Labor alliance
		  argued strongly for compulsory mass education. The full
		  democratization of the political realm was seen as
		  inevitable, and education was increasingly regarded as a
		  means to civilize the lower classes so as to "avoid
		  anarchy" (Robert Lowe's phrase, quoted in Jones [1977, p.
		  50]), i.e., to teach the lower classes proper behavior in
		  the political arena"
		  
		  threat to British world supremacy by the unified US and
		  Germany
		  
		  EUROPE IN GENERAL The typical response encompassed the
		  following elements: declaration of a national interest in
		  mass education, legislation to make schooling compulsory,
		  creation of a state educational ministry or department, and
		  establishment of state authority over existing and new
		  schools.
		  
		  "Trans- forming the masses into national citizens became a
		  standardized feature of the state-orchestrated nation-
		  building process; utilizing state-sponsored mass schooling
		  to achieve this political end became a routinely accepted
		  modus operandi (Ramirez and Boli 1982)."

		  attributed to selection bias. To control this bias
		  statistically, I use a censored probit model to evaluate
		  hypotheses about conflict escalation over the time period
		  of 1950-1985. I report four results. (1) Power parity and
		  economic development are found to influence conflict
		  nonmonotonically (2) Although joint democracy and joint
		  satisfaction with the status quo are found to have robust
		  pacifying effects on the onset of conflict, the results
		  suggest that they are unrelated to the escalation of
		  disputes to war. (3) Allied pairs of states appear less
		  likely to escalate their disputes. (4) Finally, the unified
		  model suggests that it is essential for researchers
		  interested in the escalation behavior of states to consider
		  first how states become involved in disputes. Conflict
		  onset and escalation appear to be related processes.},

@article{reed:2003b,
	Abstract = {The pacifying effect of economic interdependence on
		  conflict onset can be better understood in the context of
		  "noisy" bargaining. Specifically, trading states bargain
		  under less noisy conditions and, as a result, are unlikely
		  to engage in militarized conflict. Noise is introduced into
		  a generic take-it-or-leave-it bargaining game in the form
		  of nonspecific asymmetric information about the defender's
		  reservation value. Comparative statics show a positive
		  monotonic relationship between variance in the noise term
		  and the onset of militarized conflict. The relationships
		  among economic interdependence, variance in the noise term,
		  and conflict onset are evaluated with a Bayesian
		  heteroskedastic probit model. Historical data are used to
		  demonstrate that interdependence and uncertainty are
		  related to each other and jointly related to the onset of
		  militarized conflict. Uncertainty appears to be reduced by
		  economic interdependence, and this leads to an enhanced
		  probability of agreement short of a militarized clash. },

	Abstract = {How do nation-states' political institutions affect the
		  relations between states? This article addresses that
		  question by testing the predictions of different theories
		  linking political institutions to war outcomes.
		  Specifically, rent-seeking and regime legitimacy theories
		  predict that all democratic belligerents are more likely to
		  win wars because they fight more effectively.
		  Alternatively, other theories focusing on the domestic
		  political vulnerability of leaders and the marketplace of
		  ideas predict that democracies are likely to be more
		  careful about choosing when to start war. This would mean
		  that only democratic initiators are more likely to win.
		  Analyzing all interstate wars from 1816 to 1982 with a
		  multivariate probit model, we find that democratic
		  initiators are significantly more likely to win wars;
		  democratic targets are also more likely to win, though the
		  relationship is not as strong. We also find empirical
		  support for several control variables, including strategy,
		  terrain, and capability.},

	Abstract = {Limited attention has been paid to the intersection of
		  emotions and the etiology of terrorism. Instead, research
		  priorities have tended to focus on the structural (e.g.,
		  poverty; weak and failing states), sociopolitical (e.g.,
		  LIS foreign policy; a "clash of civilizations"), or codal
		  (e.g., madrassas; Wahhabism). The aim here is to outline an
		  agenda which transitions discourse related to the "body" of
		  the terrorist (i.e., his/her historical and social
		  positioning) to one focused on intrapsychic and
		  interpersonal emotional processes. As such, scholarship's
		  predictive and explanatory capacities will be heightened if
		  it adopts a perspective grounded in the emotions of
		  terrorists and their source communities, particularly for
		  those phenomena that suggest a fluidity of movement of
		  actors across a continuum of zealotry. Criminology and
		  criminal justice are well suited to assess the expressive
		  byproducts of humiliated fury, contempt. moral outrage, and
		  disgust and how such emotions may distillate as impulses
		  that form a basis for terror. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All

		  The purpose of this article is to analyse and reflect on

		  concentrate in particular on the publications of Spanish
		  authors. The results are not very promising. The conclusion
		  is that what is published in Spain from the perspective of
		  the psychology of the etiology of terrorism is almost
		  irrelevant. Therefore, currently Spanish psychology can
		  contribute very little to the knowledge about the risk
		  factors of terrorist actions. Psychological investigation
		  seems focused on the quantification of reality rather than

		  psychological knowledge runs the risk of becoming socially

		  processes lead to the emergence (or collapse) of a shared
		  sense of identity? Drawing on individual-level experiments
		  of identity change and societal-level theories of idea
		  diffusion from the constructivist literature, the authors
		  develop an agent-based computer simulation of identity
		  change. Four findings emerge from the analysis: (1) there
		  is a curvilinear relationship between the complexity of
		  agents'views and the emergence of shared identity, (2)
		  highly unstable environments encourage the emergence of a
		  shared identity, (3) the presence of leaders (i.e., agents
		  with greater influence in the population) in the
		  neighborhood decreases shared identity, and (4) the
		  interaction of complexity, stability, and leadership
		  produces extremely polarized societies. },

		  into its own during the past decade, not only as a
		  metatheoretical critique of currently dominant
		  neo-utilitarian approaches (neorealism and neoliberal
		  institutionalism) but increasingly in the form of detailed
		  empirical findings and theoretical insights. Constrnctivism
		  addresses many of the same issues addressed by
		  neo-utilitarianism, though from a different vantage and,
		  therefore, with different effect. It also concerns itself
		  with issues that neo-utilitarianism treats by assumption,
		  discounts, ignores, or simply cannot apprehend within its
		  characteristic ontology and/or epistemology. The
		  constructivist project has sought to open up the relatively
		  narrow theoretical confines of conventional approaches--by
		  pushing them back to problematize the interests and
		  identities of actors; deeper to incorporate the
		  intersubjective bases of social action and social order;
		  and into the dimensions of space and time to establish
		  international structure as contingent practice,
		  constraining social action but also being (re)created and,
		  therefore, potentially transformed by it.},

	Abstract = {This paper examines the robustness of explanatory
		  variables in cross-country economic growth regressions. It
		  introduces and employs a novel approach, Bayesian Averaging
		  of Classical Estimates (BACE), which constructs estimates
		  by averaging OLS coefficients across models. The weights
		  given to individual regressions have a Bayesian
		  justification similar to the Schwarz model selection
		  criterion. Of 67 explanatory variables we find 18 to be
		  significantly and robustly partially correlated with
		  long-term growth and another three variables to be
		  marginally related. The strongest evidence is for the
		  relative price of investment, primary school enrollment,
		  and the initial level of real GDP per capita. (JEL 051,
		  052, 053)
		  
		  In fact, we find that about one-fifth of the 67 variables
		  used in the analysis can be said to be significantly
		  related to growth while several more are marginally
		  related. The strongest evidence is found for primary
		  schooling enrollment, the relative price of investment
		  goods and the initial level of income where the latter
		  reflects the concept of conditional convergence. Other
		  important variables include regional dummies (such as East
		  Asia, Sub- Saharan Africa, or Latin America), some measures
		  of human capital and health (such as life expectancy,
		  proportion of a country lying in the tropics, and malaria
		  prevalence), religious dummies, and some sectoral variables
		  such as mining. The public consumption and public
		  investment shares are negatively related to growth,
		  although the results are significant only for certain prior
		  model sizes. },

		  violence has identified important economic and political
		  determinants of civil war. That literature has treated
		  civil war as an aggregate category and has not considered
		  if identity (ethnic/religious) wars have different causes
		  than nonidentity wars. The author argues that this is an
		  important distinction and that identity wars are due
		  predominantly to political grievance rather than lack of
		  economic opportunity. Ethnic heterogeneity is also
		  associated differently with identity than nonidentity wars.
		  Some systemic variables are also important determinants of
		  civil war, and these have been neglected in the existing
		  literature. An important new result is that living in a bad
		  neighborhood, with undemocratic neighbors or neighbors at
		  war, significantly increases a country's risk of
		  experiencing ethnic civil war. },

		  mortality of socially proximate others with decreased
		  (increased) fertility. On a more general level this problem
		  directly concerns the translation of the effects of
		  macro-demographic forces such as mortality into micro-level
		  individual behavior through social interaction. Using
		  unique data that combine identification of individuals
		  belonging to women's social networks with direct
		  measurement of these network members' mortality experience,
		  this research demonstrates such a linkage. Information
		  concerning the level and variation in infant mortality
		  available to women from a small Nepalese mountain
		  population in their social networks is seen to influence
		  the tempo of their fertility. It is suggested that the
		  methodology employed has important implications for

		  to establish system share capability and thereby determine
		  velocity of dyadic ratio change prior to the event (war or

		  strong support to the theory. In general, the trend was in

		  Beitrag zu den Vorbedingungen und Begleiterfordernissen

		  and cultural identity in religiously and ethnically
		  motivated terrorism. It is proposed that terrorism
		  represents the confluence of a cultural identity strongly
		  based in collectivism and in fundamentalist adherence to
		  religious or cultural principles, a social identity based
		  in sharp contrasts between one's own group and groups
		  perceived as threats, and a foreclosed and authoritarian
		  sense of personal identity or, less often, a diffused and
		  aimless personal identity. Examples from
		  religious-extremist and ethnic conflicts in which terrorism
		  has been employed are used to illustrate the tenets
		  advanced here. Recommendations for addressing and
		  preventing the threat of terrorism are discussed.},

		  and income on support for suicide bombing among Muslim
		  publics in six predominantly Muslim countries that have
		  experienced suicide bombings: Indonesia, Jordan, Lebanon,
		  Morocco, Pakistan, and Turkey. The authors make two
		  contributions. First, they present a conceptual model,
		  which has been lacking in the literature. Second, they
		  consider attitudes toward two different targets of suicide
		  bombings: civilians within the respondent's country and
		  Western military and political personnel in Iraq. The
		  authors find that the effect of educational attainment and
		  income on support for suicide bombings varies across
		  countries and targets.The findings therefore draw attention
		  to the difficulties of making generalizations about Muslim
		  countries and the importance of distinguishing between
		  targets of suicide bombings.},

	Abstract = {Islamist militancy in Pakistan has long stood atop the
		  international security agenda, yet there is almost no
		  systematic evidence about why individual Pakistanis support
		  Islamist militant organizations. An analysis of data from a
		  nationally representative survey of urban Pakistanis
		  refutes four influential conventional wisdoms about why
		  Pakistanis support Islamic militancy. First, there is no
		  clear relationship between poverty and support for
		  militancy. If anything, support for militant organizations
		  is increasing in terms of both subjective economic
		  well-being and community economic performance. Second,
		  personal religiosity and support for sharia law are poor
		  predictors of support for Islamist militant organizations.
		  Third, support for political goals espoused by legal
		  Islamist parties is a weak indicator of support for
		  militant organizations. Fourth, those who support core
		  democratic principles or have faith in Pakistan's
		  democratic process are not less supportive of militancy.
		  Taken together, these results suggest that commonly
		  prescribed solutions to Islamist militancy-economic
		  development, democratization, and the like-may be
		  irrelevant at best and might even be counterproductive.},

	Abstract = {We present a unified theory and test of extended immediate
		  deterrence-unified in the sense that we employ our
		  theoretical deterrence model as our statistical model in
		  the empirical analysis. The theoretical model is a
		  straightforward formalization of the deterrence logic in
		  Huth (1988) and Huth and Russett (1984), coupled with
		  private information concerning utilities. Our statistical
		  analysis suggests that the attacker and defender's
		  decisions are influenced by the balance of forces, nuclear
		  weapons, defender-protege military alliances, arms
		  transfers, and trade, as well as the regime types of those
		  involved. Many of these findings contradict previous
		  research by Huth (1988) and Huth and Russett (1988). We
		  find that many of the variables involved in the deterrence
		  calculus are nonmonotonically linked to the probability of
		  deterrence success or war. We illustrate the results with
		  case studies of the Soviet-Japanese dispute over Manchukuo
		  (1937-1938) and the Berlin Blockade (1948).},

	Abstract = {The democratic peace has received substantial empirical
		  support in the modern international system. The consistency
		  of the results does not imply that reasonable critiques do
		  not exist, that is, the effects of development, liberal
		  economic structures, and preferences. These challenges,
		  however, tend to strongly correlate with democracy, making
		  direct statistical tests inefficient and not necessarily
		  convincing. This study attempts to evaluate these
		  challenges and extend the temporal domain of the democratic
		  peace through an empirical analysis of Renaissance Italy.
		  The data set contains the seven major powers of Renaissance
		  Italy between 1250 and 1494, with measures of war, power,
		  regime type, preferences, and contiguity. The analyses show
		  that joint republicanism, power preponderance, and
		  preference similarity decrease the probability of war. },

		  formation and its interaction with foreign investment
		  across an entire epoch of rapid and profound economic
		  transformation, the authors gathered data on the complete
		  ownership histories of 1,696 of the largest Hungarian
		  enterprises from 1987 to 2001. They develop a social
		  sequence analysis to identify distinctive pathways whereby
		  firms use network resources to buffer uncertainty, hide or
		  restructure assets, or gain knowledge and legitimacy.
		  During this period, networked property grew, stabilized,
		  and involved a growing proportion of foreign capital.
		  Cohesive networks of recombinant property were robust, and
		  in fact integrated foreign investment. Although
		  multinationals, through their subsidiaries, dissolved ties
		  in joint venture arrangements, the authors find evidence
		  that they also built durable networks. These findings
		  suggest that developing economies do not necessarily face a
		  forced choice between networks of global reach and those of
		  local embeddedness.},

	Abstract = {Two fundamental arguments are presented to answer whether
		  dyadic balances or preponderances of military capability
		  are more peaceful. First, the impact of the dyadic balance
		  of military capabilities on interstate conflict,
		  conditional on the level of dyadic interest similarity, is
		  assessed. Many theoretical works in the field argue that
		  the degree of interest similarity gives meaning to the
		  balance of military forces, yet few empirical studies
		  investigate the conditionality of these two variables. The
		  second argument is that interstate conflict is a
		  heterogeneous outcome. A selection model that seeks to
		  explain the severity of interstate disputes is used to
		  address this concern. Using data from all interstate dyads
		  between 1886 and 1992, results show that dyads with similar
		  interests have less severe disputes, and under the
		  condition of interest dissimilarity, balances rather than
		  preponderances of military capability are associated with
		  less severe disputes.},

@article{sylvan:etal:2004,
	Abstract = {This article addresses the issue of how international
		  relations theories and experts do at forecasting
		  Israeli-Palestinian relations. A group of academics who
		  study the Middle East were brought together to set forth
		  their logic and arguments concerning possible future
		  scenarios of Israeli-Palestinian relations. The article
		  reports on a 'rule-based' computational model built upon
		  the reasoning of these experts. Sensitivity analysis of the
		  model is summarized, and four empirical tests of the model
		  are reported. Relations between Middle East states,
		  externally generated existential threats to Israel, and
		  domestic structural factors such as coalition politics in
		  Israel emerge as driving forces in the sensitivity
		  analysis. Further examination shows that the model is in
		  theoretical harmony with scholars who have employed
		  two-level games and has some similarity to realist
		  explanations and frameworks emphasizing public opinion.
		  Model tests reveal relatively solid results: comparisons
		  with other forecasts generally favor this model, while both
		  the cases of the Labor Party coming to power in Israel and
		  a change in Jordanian behavior after the death of King
		  Hussein lend further support to the model presented here.
		  Finally, when the scholars who served as the expert group
		  to produce these forecasts were asked to reflect back on
		  the process, they exhibited the same rationalizations that
		  have been found in other expert-based forecasts, even
		  though the results of the forecasts were more favorable
		  than many such forecasts.},

		  determinant of terrorism, so that a nonlinear relation

	Abstract = {Theoretical insights from evolutionary psychology and
		  biology can help academics and policymakers better
		  understand both deep and proximate causes of Islamic
		  suicide terrorism. The life sciences can contribute
		  explanations that probe the influence of the following
		  forces on the phenomenon of Islamic suicide terrorism: high
		  levels of gender differentiation, the prevalence of
		  polygyny, and the obstruction of marriage markets delaying
		  marriage for young adult men in the modern Middle East. The
		  influence of these forces has been left virtually
		  unexplored in the social sciences, despite their
		  presumptive application in this case. Life science
		  explanations should be integrated with more conventional
		  social science explanations, which include international
		  anarchy, U.S. hegemony and presence in the Middle East, and
		  culturally molded discourse sanctioning suicide terrorism
		  in the Islamic context. Such a consilient approach, melding
		  the explanatory power of the social and life sciences,
		  offers greater insight into the causal context of Islamic
		  fundamentalist suicide terrorism, the motivation of suicide
		  terrorists, and effective approaches to subvert this form
		  of terrorism.},

	Abstract = {miquel's reform built on plans that originated around a

		  communal units, as this was likely to create advantages for
		  big towns and rich areas with excellent ground (agro). On
		  the other hand, for Miquel the local level responsibility
		  ensured that benefit and cost of taxation would be closely
		  related. Miquel saw the local taxes as strengthening the
		  ability of kreise as an economic union, which' task it was
		  to create the conditions under which the neighborly and
		  economic cohabitation and the employment of its citizens
		  were based. s. 310 herrfurth on the other hand, thought it
		  would be the task of the state to redistribute from richer
		  to poorer localities, something that miquel opposed. In
		  addition, herrfurth fundamentally opposed the treatment of
		  Gutsbezirke (strong landed interest) in which the main
		  wealth would also control the political power, and thus
		  could control their own tax collection. however, this was

		  (some of) the land lost to the secessionist state, while
		  the secessionist state's leader is motivated by the
		  benefits of acquiring even more land. The peaceful versus
		  violent secession process further affects whether these
		  desires escalate into the use of force. The results--based
		  on the examination of the consequences of all
		  twentieth-century secessions--reveal that ethnically based
		  territorial disputes play a much greater role in conflict
		  onset than do their economically or strategically based
		  counterparts and that peaceful secessions lead to peaceful
		  relations. },

		  performance and liking for subordinates and subordinates'
		  role ambiguity and conflict. A field study of 272
		  superior-subordinate dyads produced results that support
		  the notion that increasing dissimilarity in
		  superior-subordinate demographic characteristics, referred
		  to here as "relational demography," is associated with
		  lower effectiveness as perceived by superiors, less
		  personal attraction on the part of superiors for
		  subordinates, and increased role ambiguity experienced by
		  subordinates. These effects were found even after we

	Abstract = {The Democratic Peace Proposition, which states that no two
		  democracies have ever gone to war with each other, has been
		  questioned by scholars who claim that such pacific behavior
		  among free states does not apply to lower forms of
		  conflict. In particular, Kegley and Hermann contend that
		  democracies intervene in the affairs of other liberal
		  states via overt military acts or covert machinations. In
		  many cases, they argue that dyadic democratic interventions
		  (DDIs) occur more frequently than would be expected given
		  the number of jointly democratic dyads in the international
		  system. I examine their research design and suggest changes
		  to their concepts of states, interventions, and regime
		  type, as well as their sample size and definition of dyads
		  in the international system. I implement these changes and
		  retest such arguments on a sample of interventions from
		  1945 to 1991. I find 11 cases where a democracy intervenes
		  against another democracy, but these cases are rare in
		  comparison to interventions conducted by democratic and/or
		  autocratic states in undemocratic states, or by autocratic
		  states against democratic states. Furthermore, these DDIs
		  are less likely to occur than the presence of democracy in
		  the international system would suggest.},

		  Data and theoretical material were gathered from the
		  world's unclassified literature. Multiple theories and some
		  demographic data have been published, but very few
		  controlled empirical studies have been conducted
		  investigating the psychological bases of terrorism. The
		  field is largely characterized by theoretical speculation
		  based on subjective interpretation of anecdotal
		  observations. Moreover, most studies and theories fail to
		  take into account the great heterogeneity of terrorists.
		  Many practical, conceptual, and psychological barriers have
		  slowed progress in this important field. Nonetheless, even
		  at this early stage of terrorism studies, preliminary
		  reports suggest that modifiable social and psychological
		  factors contribute to the genesis of the terrorist
		  mind-set. Psychological scholarship could possibly mitigate
		  the risk of catastrophic attack by initiating the long
		  overdue scientific study of terrorist mentalities.},

@book{vonheckel:1907,
	Abstract = {S.132:
		  
		  Reproduktivit{\"a}t der Steuer: "Denn der
		  Wert{\"u}bertragung steht kein spezieller empfangener
		  Gegenwert gegen{\"u}ber, es wird nicht separat nach dem
		  Grundsatz der speziellen Entgeltlichkeit abgerechnet. Die
		  generelle Entgeltlichkeit liegt vielmehr in den
		  gro{\ss}enteils immateriellen und imponderabilen Leistungen
		  des Staats und in der mittelbaren F{\"o}rderung der
		  Einzelinteressen {\"u}ber den Umweg der Gesamtinteressen.
		  Die Einzelwirtschaften empfangen Vorteile aus allen
		  Wechselbeziehungen zur Gemeinwirtschaft. Die mit den
		  Steuern hergestellten Leistungen und errichteten oder
		  unterhaltennen Anstalten m{\"u}ssen die nationale
		  Gesamtarbeit und ihre Produktivit{\"a}t befruchten und
		  indirekt die Lebensinteressen des einzelnen Besteuerten
		  f{\"o}rdern. Sie entiwckeln reproduktiv die Produktion und
		  das gesamte Wirtschaftsleben. Wir k{\"o}nnen daher von
		  einer relativen Reproduktivit{\"a}t der Steuer sprechen. In
		  je h{\"o}herm Grade aber die Reproduktion wiederbelebend
		  wirkt, desto mehr k{\"o}nnen die Steuern ausgedehnt
		  erweitert und verst{\"a}rkt werden. Wo aber diese
		  reproduktive Wirkung fehlt, wo das Wirtschaftsleben aus den
		  Staatst{\"a}tigkeiten keine neuen, fruchtbringenden
		  Anregungen empf{\"a}ngt, da wird die Steuerlaast zum
		  Steuerdruck, zur l{\"a}hmenden {\"U}berlastung der
		  Erwerbslebens, wozu sich dann erfahrungsgem{\"a}{\ss} eine
		  h{\"o}chst ungerechte und ungleichm{\"a}{\ss}ige
		  Steuerverteilung mit starker Benachteiligung der unteren
		  Klassen zu gesellen pflegt."
		  
		  S.153 Wie alle eink{\"u}nfte eines Wirtschaftsbetribes
		  gewisse Ausgaben oder Kosten des Betriebs verursachen, so
		  ist dies auch der Fall bei der Finanzwirtschaft und im
		  Steuerwesen. Auch hier handelt es sich zun{\"a}chst um
		  Rohertr{\"a}ge, die erst nach Abzug der Betriebs
		  aufwendungen sich in Reinertr{\"a}ge verwandeln. Der
		  Staatsaufwand umfa{\ss}t daher zwei Gruppen von Ausgaben,
		  die Betriebs- und Er hebungskosten der einzelnen
		  Einnahmezweige einer- und die eigent lichen
		  Staatsverwaltungsausgaben andererseits. Nur die
		  Reinertr{\"a}ge der Besteuerung sind somit zur Bestreitung
		  der Staatsausgaben verf{\"u}gbar. Im Interesse der
		  Staatsverwaltung liegt es daher, einen m{\"o}glichst hohen
		  Reinertrag aus den Steuern zu erzielen und die
		  Erhebungskosten m{\"o}glichst einzuschr{\"a}nken. Wir haben
		  es des halb im wesentlichen zu tun mit einer Anwendung des
		  „{\"o}konomi schen Prinzips" oder des „Prinzips der
		  Wirtschaftlichkeit" auf das Steuerwesen, um mit
		  m{\"o}glichst geringen Opfern an Kosten, m{\"o}glichst viel
		  Erfolg an Einkommen zu erzielen. Denn je mehr es gelingt,
		  jene in ihrer H{\"o}he zu reduzieren, desto ausgiebiger
		  k{\"o}nnen die Kollektivbed{\"u}rfnisse befriedigt werden.
		  Der Staat mu{\ss} in dieser Hin sicht nach den gleichen
		  Erw{\"a}gungen verfahren wie jede andere Einzelwirtschaft.
		  Die Erhebungkosten sind am h{\"o}chsten bei den Z{\"o}llen
		  und Verbrauchssteuern, die einen komplizierten,
		  kostspieligen Verwaltungsorganismus und zahlreiche
		  Kontroll- und {\"U}berwachungs beh{\"o}rden notwendig
		  machen. Dagegen sind sie geringer bei den direkten Steuern,
		  namentlich wenn der Staat die Gemeinden auch mit der
		  Erhebung der Staatssteuern betraut. (...) Die Entwickelung
		  dieser Zahlungsmethoden ist aber in den meisten Staaten
		  noch gering.
		  
		  S.160 Die volkswirtschaftliche Wertung und die
		  einzelwirtschaftliche Wirkung der Steuer h{\"a}ngt
		  demgem{\"a}{\ss} von den {\"o}konomisch-technischen und
		  sozialen Reflexen ab, die jene G{\"u}ter- und
		  Wert{\"u}bertragungen von den Einzelwirtschaften auf die
		  Kollektivwirtschaften hervorrufen. Sie werden allerdings
		  meist mittelbarer und immaterieller Art sein. Die Grenzen
		  der Be steuerung liegen eben, wie schon a. a. 0.
		  nachgewiesen wurde (s. o. I {\S} 3), in ihrer relativen
		  Reproduktion. Ma{\ss} und Methode der Benutzung des
		  Steuerfonds ist damit durch den Grad der {\"U}ber
		  schu{\ss}erzeugung bedingt, in dem eine solche {\"u}ber den
		  natio nalen Kr{\"a}fte- und Wertverbrauch m{\"o}glich ist.
		  Je mehr es gelingt, so {\"U}bersch{\"u}sse zu
		  reproduzieren, desto st{\"a}rker kann auch die An spannung
		  der Besteuerung sein. Wenn aber ein Mi{\ss}verh{\"a}ltnis
		  zwischen dieser und jenen eintritt, dann ist die Grenze der
		  Steuer leistungsf{\"a}higkeit erreicht. Jedes Mehr an
		  Belastung bedeutet ein Weniger an wirtschaftlicher
		  Produktivkraft, wodurch zuerst eine Stagnation und sodann
		  ein allm{\"a}hliges Einschlafen der nationalen Kr{\"a}fte
		  herbeigef{\"u}hrt wird, das die V{\"o}lker zwingt, sich mit
		  dem Notwendigsten in ihrer Finanzwirtschaft zu bescheiden.
		  Sie werden zu Greisen unter den V{\"o}lkern und siechen
		  dahin.
		  
		  S.164 Die Mittel liegen aber mehr auf dem Boden einer
		  mittelbaren Pr{\"a}vention als in der unmittelbaren
		  Repression. Sie k{\"o}nnen bestehen in der Ausdehnung der
		  Staatst{\"a}tigkeiten auch auf dem Gebiete der materiellen
		  Produktion, in der Erwerbung wichtiger Anlagen und
		  Kapitalien durch den Staat (Bergwerke!), in der Schaffung
		  gesamtheitlicher Organisationen zur Eind{\"a}mmung der
		  individuellen Interessen zugunsten der Gemeinschaft und end
		  lich in der Bef{\"o}rderung aller Organbildung, die
		  zwischen den Ex tremen des Besitzes und der Besitzlosigkeit
		  leistungsf{\"a}hige Zwischen glieder schafft. {\"U}berall
		  handelt es sich nicht darum, Vorhandenes in seiner
		  Entwickelung durch Gewalt zu hemmen, sondern korrelative
		  Institute ins Leben zu rufen, die einen erg{\"a}nzenden
		  oder ersetzen den Ausgleich begr{\"u}nden. Ein brutaler
		  Eingriff in die Verteilung des Volksverm{\"o}gens und
		  Volkseinkommens vermittelst der Besteuerung mu{\ss} nach dem Gesagten dem Wesen der Steuer fremd bleiben. 1) },

	Abstract = {little administrative knowledge of ownership in many
		  areas, thus call for landr{\"a}te to collect data on
		  ownership in 1838, but nobody followed, after 1859
		  landr{\"a}te were ordered to give statistical summeries of
		  their kreise every three years, but again very few followed
		  this order. a year later, no landrat from gumbinnen,
		  marienwerder, brandenburg, or danzig had followed the order
		  and only five out of the 28 in pommern and only two out of
		  the 61 in schlesien. but even when delivered it was clear
		  they were often not correct
		  
		  page 252: hugo solger, landrat in beuthen im
		  abgeordnetenhaus 1869: "Die Steuern gehen ein; aber glauben
		  sie etwa, dass der Ortserheber die Steuerrollen und
		  Heberrollen alle in der Ordnung hat, wie er sie haben soll?
		  Nicht im Mindesten. Er macht sich mit Bleistift in der
		  LIste Zeichen mit Strichen, Kreuzen, Nullen, usw., so dass
		  der Revisor, wenn er kommt, daraus unm{\"o}glich klug
		  werden kann. Aber wenn der Steuertag kommt, so sind die
		  Steuern p{\"u}nktlich da. Wo der Ortserheber sie
		  herbekommt, das ist seine Sache."
		  
		  due to the liberalization of ownership, many land parcels
		  were split and sold to different owners. whenever this
		  happened , the new tax levels should have been assessed and
		  new owners registered, however seldom did the local
		  authorities follow through for all transactions. local
		  bureaucracy was incapable to keep up with the demands what
		  was seen as necessary by the higher ups.
		  
		  reform of political participation, instead of voting rights
		  based on landownership at the local level,i.e. each owner
		  one vote, local votes also connected to income to ensure
		  the continued domincance of rich elites, knights lost
		  influence, power was less heredetary and more given by the
		  state, thus could potentially be taken away..
		  
		  after 1872, increase in power of the landrate, especially
		  since they received more power to spend etc and increase
		  the infrastructure of the kreise.
		  
		  in 1873, the deputy landrat in loebau stepped down after 20
		  years, because of his frugality in terms of investment in
		  road infrastructure he was charged with ''Bef{\"o}rderung
		  von Finsternis und R{\"u}ckschritt''in },

@article{walt:1997,
	Abstract = {John Vasquez's assessment of realism suffers from three
		  serious flaws. First, his reliance on Imre Lakatos's (1970)
		  model of scientific progress is problematic, because the
		  Lakatosian model has been largely rejected by contemporary
		  historians and philosophers of science. Second, Vasquez
		  understates the range and diversity of the realist research
		  program and mistakenly sees disagreements among realists as
		  evidence of theoretical degeneration. Finally, he overlooks
		  the progressive character of contemporary realist theory,
		  largely because he does not consider all the relevant
		  literature. Disagreements within and across competing
		  research programs are essential to progress and should be
		  welcomed, but Vasquez's effort suggests that criticism will
		  be most helpful when it seeks to do more than merely
		  delegitimate a particular research tradition.},

@article{ward:etal:2007,
	Abstract = {Militarized interstate disputes are widely thought to be
		  less likely among democratic countries that have high
		  levels of trade and extensive participation in
		  international organizations. We reexamine this broad
		  finding of the Kantian peace literature in the context of a
		  model that incorporates the high degree of dependency among
		  countries. Based on in-sample statistical tests, as well as
		  out-of-sample, predictive cross-validation, we find that
		  results frequently cited in the literature are plagued by
		  overfitting and cannot be characterized as identifying the
		  underlying structure through which international conflict
		  is influenced by democracy, trade, and international
		  governmental organizations. We conclude that much of the
		  statistical association typically reported in this
		  literature apparently stems from three components: (1)
		  geographical proximity, (2) dependence among militarized
		  interstate disputes with the same initiator or target, and
		  (3) the higher-order dependencies in these dyadic data.
		  Once these are incorporated, covariates associated with the
		  Kantian peace tripod lose most of their statistical power.
		  We do find that higher levels of joint democracy are
		  associated with lower probabilities of militarized
		  interstate dispute involvement. We find that despite high
		  statistical significance and putative substantive
		  importance, none of the variables representing the Kantian
		  tripod is associated with any substantial degree of
		  predictive power.},

		  are discussed. This formulation is empirically examined
		  using interaction data taken from the COPDAB data bank.
		  After presenting the static results for 132 nation-states,
		  the behavioral power of the 10 most powerful nation-states
		  is empirically examined and discussed over time (1948-1978)
		  in the separate dimensions of conflict and cooperation, as
		  well as the combined dimension of total interaction. The
		  ability to influence multilateral politics through conflict
		  behavior is found to be quite distinct from the ability to
		  use cooperation as a means of influence.},

@article{wendt:1992,
	Abstract = {The claim that international institutions can transform
		  state interests is central to neoliberal challenges to the
		  realist assumption that "process" (interaction and learning
		  among states) cannot fundamentally affect system
		  "structure" (anarchy and the distribution of capabilities).
		  Systematic development of this claim, however, has been
		  hampered by the neoliberals' commitment to rational choice
		  theory, which treats interests as exogenously given and
		  thus offers only a weak form of institutional analysis. A
		  growing body of international relations scholarship points
		  to ways in which the identities and interests of states are
		  socially constructed by knowledgeable practice. This
		  article builds a bridge between this scholarship and
		  neoliberalism by developing a theory of identity- and
		  interest-formation in support of the neoliberal claim that
		  international institutions can transform state interests.
		  Its substantive focus is the realist view that anarchies
		  are necessarily self-help systems, which justifies
		  disinterest in processes of identity- and
		  interest-formation. Self-help is a function not of anarchy
		  but of process and, as such, is itself an institution that
		  determines the meaning of anarchy and the distribution of
		  power for state action. The article concludes with an
		  examination of how this institution can be transformed by
		  practices of sovereignty, by an evolution of cooperation,
		  and by critical strategic practice.},

	Abstract = {The Rational Design project is impressive on its own
		  terms. However, it does not address other approaches
		  relevant to the design of international institutions. To
		  facilitate comparison I survey two "contrast spaces" around
		  it. The first shares the project's central question-What
		  explains institutional design?-but addresses alternative
		  explanations of two types: rival explanations and
		  explanations complementary but deeper in the causal chain.
		  The second contrast begins with a different question: What
		  kind of knowledge is needed to design institutions in the
		  real world? Asking this question reveals epistemological
		  differences between positive social science and
		  institutional design that can be traced to different
		  orientations toward time. Making institutions is about the
		  future and has an intrinsic normative element. Explaining
		  institutions is about the past and does not necessarily
		  have this normative dimension. To avoid "driving with the
		  rearview mirror" we need two additional kinds of knowledge
		  beyond that developed in this volume, knowledge about
		  institutional effectiveness and knowledge about what values
		  to pursue. As such, the problem of institutional design is
		  a fruitful site for developing a broader and more practical
		  conception of social science that integrates normative and
		  positive concerns.},

	Abstract = {This study focuses on mediation as a means for mitigating
		  or at least minimizing the potentially turbulent and
		  violent consequences of international crises. Two main
		  research questions are explored: (1) Does mediation in
		  general affect the dynamics and outcomes of crisis
		  negotiations? and (2) Does the impact of mediation vary in
		  accordance with mediator style? Data are drawn from the
		  International Crisis Behavior data set and from ongoing
		  experimental work with human subjects. The historical data
		  reveal that mediated crises are more typically
		  characterized by compromise among crisis actors, are more
		  likely to end in agreements, and show a tendency toward
		  long-term tension reduction. The experimental research
		  confirmed the relationship between mediation and the
		  achievement of agreement and also revealed that mediation
		  leads to crises of shorter duration and to greater
		  satisfaction by the parties with the outcome. A
		  manipulative mediation style is more likely to yield
		  favorable crisis management outcomes than is a more
		  restrictive facilitative style. },

@article{wintrobe:2006,
	Abstract = {This paper studies extremist behaviour, and its connection
		  to authoritarianism. I divide extremists into two groups,
		  leaders, who demand extremist acts such as assassinations,
		  suicide terror or other forms of political violence from
		  followers, who supply them. I assume that both the leaders
		  of extremist groups and their followers are rational. The
		  paper looks at three examples: Communism, Nationalism and
		  Islamic Fundamentalism. I show that leaders with extreme
		  ideologies also tend to adopt violent methods when there is
		  an indivisibility between the intermediate goal of the
		  group and its ultimate goal. Turning to followers, the most
		  important innovation of the paper is a simple model which
		  explains how it is possible for a person to rationally
		  commit suicide to further the goals of a group. The most
		  important policy implications of the paper are, firstly,
		  that one should look at the goals of extremist group in
		  order to understand their actions. If one can un-bundle the
		  goal or make the indivisible divisible, then there may be
		  ways to provide these goals in a way which satisfies some
		  of the potential supporters of the group and thus dries up
		  support for the grander ambitions of the leaders of
		  extremist groups. Secondly, the provision of programs which
		  foster social cohesion tends to dry up an important motive
		  for extremist activity: the desire for solidarity. Thirdly,
		  policy towards terrorists should combine the use of
		  "carrot" and "stick". Finally, I argue that authoritarian
		  regimes rather than democracies or totalitarian regimes are
		  the most likely sources of suicide terror. So democracy is
		  indeed part of the solution to the problem of suicide
		  terrorism.},

	Abstract = {In 1973 Granovetter formulated the strength-of-weak-ties
		  hypothesis (SWT), which became the foundation of a vast
		  sociological literature on social networks in labor
		  markets. Until now, SWT has never been directly tested but
		  treated instead as a surrogate for the relationship between
		  an actor's network and labor market outcomes such as
		  characteristics of a job obtained. The paper restates SWT
		  as a proposition about the probability of getting a job as
		  a function of within-actor differences in tie strength and
		  tests it with data on hires carried out in one Russian city
		  in 1998. In support of SWT, the results show that a worker
		  is more likely to get a job through one of her weak ties
		  rather than strong ties. The advantages of weak ties lie in
		  their abilities to provide timely access to non-redundant
		  information and to influence employers directly. In
		  contrast, strong ties are associated with indirect
		  influence on employers through well-connected
		  intermediaries. The estimates come from a within-worker
		  fixed-effect conditional logistic regression and thereby
		  provide rare evidence of an association between information
		  and influence transferred through social ties and labor
		  market outcomes, independent of workers' individual
		  characteristics.},
