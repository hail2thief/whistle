		  economy, compensation to have coalition for free trade -
		  open economy, no compensation -> authoritarianism
		  
		  two factors determining attitudes of econ actors towards
		  trade: - potential gains of losses from trade - probablity
		  of gains or losses (uncertainty)
		  
		  three actors, one pro free trade (O) , one against (C),
		  one, where his opinion depends on the int. business cycle
		  (P) P is pivotal, can be bought by compensation from P or O
		  
		  AGAIN, Boix does a poor job at interpreting the interaction

		  OLD Abstract: Simultaneous bargaining game over trade
		  policy and social policy; Close economy, lower social
		  spending, open economy and democracy higher social spending
		  to get losers of open trade policy into the coalition, free
		  trade in dictatorships, no incentives for higher social
		  spending; Preferences determined by to factors, potential
		  benefits from trade, and the probability that gains or
		  losses will be made from trade; Free trade party will offer
		  bigger spending packages than protectionist party because
		  they have to overcome they loss of the pivotal voter ⇒
		  leads to bigger spending in free trade regimes Dictatorship
		  if burden of establishing dictatorship is not exceeding
		  gains from either staying in a closed econ or becoming and
		  open econ, one party has to have larger resources to
		  establish a dictatorship than the other one, also if
		  establishing a dict is cheaper than compensating the
		  pivotal voter Findings: trade grows ⇒ public expenditure

		  innovations of the past 200 years, only rivalled by the
		  value added tax.
		  
		  Moreover, economic history is littered with examples of
		  early attempts to introduce income taxation that
		  subsequently failed because of the lack of fiscal capacity
		  to extract sufficient yields. Finally, the fact that many
		  countries resorted to temporary taxation of incomes in
		  times of war strongly suggests that fiscal pressures might
		  have played a key role in spreading income taxation during
		  the 19th and early 20th century. p161
		  
		  income tax complicated, trade tax easier to collect p.165
		  
		  we find evidence that reductions in tax collection costs,
		  spending pressures and to a lesser extent social learning
		  played a significant role for the adoption decision. Voting
		  institutions were also important, but in surprising ways.
		  We find evidence that the extension of the franchise at
		  first reduces the likelihood of income taxation. But once
		  the franchise surpasses a threshold (estimated to be around
		  63% of the adult population) the effect reverses and
		  further extension of the franchise makes it more likely
		  that income tax will be levied},

  abstract	= { Albania provides a small amount of social assistance to
		  nearly 20% of its population through a system which allows
		  a degree of community discretion in determining
		  distribution. This study indicates that relative to other
		  safety net programs in low-income countries, social
		  assistance in Albania is fairly well targeted to the poor.
		  Moreover, the poverty targeting exceeds that which could be
		  expected on the basis of proxy indicators of targeting
		  alone; communes appear to be using local information
		  unlikely to be obtained on the basis of a questionnaire or
		  formula. This remains the case conditional on the level of
		  funding allocated from the central government.},

		  tax-evading individuals based on the bank's perception of
		  true income. This insight leads to a novel approach to
		  estimate tax evasion from privatesector adaptation to
		  semiformality. We use household microdata from a large bank
		  in Greece and replicate bank models of credit capacity,
		  credit card limits, and mortgage payments to infer the
		  bank's estimate of individuals' true income. We estimate a
		  lower bound of 28 billion euros of unreported income for
		  Greece. The foregone government revenues amount to 31
		  percent of the deficit for 2009. Primary taxevading
		  occupations are doctors, engineers, private tutors,
		  accountants, financial service agents, and lawyers. Testing
		  the industry distribution against a number of
		  redistribution and incentive theories, our evidence
		  suggests that industries with low paper trail and
		  industries supported by parliamentarians have more tax
		  evasion. We conclude by commenting on the property right of
		  informal income.},

  abstract	= {Over a period of time two nations establish between them
		  an interaction range which they perceive as "normal." This
		  normal relations range (on a scale from very friendly to
		  very hostile) tends to incorporate most of a dyad's
		  interactions and is bound by upper and lower critical
		  thresholds. Conflict escalation is the movement to above
		  the upper critical threshold, and conflict reduction is the
		  return to below that threshold. Using the frequency and
		  intensity of inter-nation events data coded from the 1956
		  Suez crisis (from July 26, 1956, through January 11, 1957)
		  and a thirteen-point scaling instrument, the author shows
		  that during the escalation phase (in comparison with
		  preescalation and with conflict reduction phases)
		  conflicting parties tend to (a) exhibit a symmetrical
		  pattern of hostile interactions and (b) reduce the
		  chronological time intervening between consecutive hostile
		  interactions. Furthermore he shows that during conflict
		  reduction the conflicting parties tend to exhibit (c)
		  asymmetrical hostile interaction patterns and (d) increase
		  the chronological time (or temporal distance) between
		  consecutive hostile events. In an exploratory hypothesis
		  the author suggests that conflicting dyads tend to reduce
		  their hostile interactions to within their normal relations
		  range when (1) they achieve or frustrate their goals, (2)
		  incur heavy costs, or (3) they feel pressured by changes in
		  the domestic and international environments.},

		  power to extract ressources from those who lack it 2. loss
		  of the state over the monopoly of power
		  
		  -distinction to revolution: revolution yields new power
		  oder, state failure leads to chaos
		  
		  -correlation of state failure with civil war: Africa
		  1970-1995: 60% of observations with failed states had civil
		  wars, 70% of observations with civil wars were also failed
		  states
		  
		  - much more known about civil war than about state failure
		  
		  Factors of state failure: 1. economic factors: - poverty -
		  grievance or higher financial incentives for rebellion -
		  fiscal dearth of the gov't - gov't that can't pay their
		  employees (civil servants, military) are worse off -
		  ressource wealth (curse) - seems that only oil wealth
		  matters negatively, but what is the theoretical mechanism,
		  because gov't earn oil revenue not rebells - maybe gov't
		  doesn't care for citizens because tax revenue doesn't
		  matter
		  
		  2. ethnicity - Bates (2008) as well as Fearon & Laition
		  (1996, 2003) find no evidence for the claim that higher
		  ethnic diversity leads to civil war - concentration -
		  probable that curvelinear relationship between size of the
		  largest ethnic group and civil war in Africa - Rule by
		  Minorities - in interaction with ethnic fractionalization
		  and use of fear makes violence more likely
		  
		  3. Democratization - inverted U relationship between regime
		  type and civil war (see Cheibub critique of the democracy
		  index though) },

		  United States. Precise images and measures of network
		  structure are derived from reports of relationships that
		  occurred over a period of 18 months between 1993 and 1995.
		  The study offers a comparison of the structural
		  characteristics of the observed network to simulated
		  networks conditioned on the distribution of ties; the
		  observed structure reveals networks characterized by longer
		  contact chains and fewer cycles than expected. This article
		  identifies the micromechanisms that generate networks with
		  structural features similar to the observed network.
		  Implications for disease transmission dynamics and social
		  policy are explored. },

		  Grynavisk's substantive analyses are fully consistent with
		  our prior theoretical conjecture about international
		  conflict. We note that they also agree with our main
		  methodological point that out-of-sample forecasting
		  performance should be a primary standard used to evaluate
		  international conflict studies. However, we demonstrate
		  that all other methodological conclusions drawn by de
		  Marchi, Gelpi, and Gryanaviski are false. For example, by
		  using the same evaluative criterion for both models, it is
		  easy to see that their claim that properly specified logit
		  models outperform neural network models is incorrect.
		  Finally, we show that flexible neural network models are
		  able to identify important empirical relationships between
		  democracy and conflict that the logit model excludes a
		  priori; this should not be surprising since the logit model
		  is merely a limiting special case of the neural network
		  model.},

  abstract	= {In this article, we show that de Marchi, Gelpi, and
		  Grynavisk's substantive analyses are fully consistent with
		  our prior theoretical conjecture about international
		  conflict. We note that they also agree with our main
		  methodological point that out-of-sample forecasting
		  performance should be a primary standard used to evaluate
		  international conflict studies. However, we demonstrate
		  that all other methodological conclusions drawn by de
		  Marchi, Gelpi, and Gryanaviski are false. For example, by
		  using the same evaluative criterion for both models, it is
		  easy to see that their claim that properly specified logit
		  models outperform neural network models is incorrect.
		  Finally, we show that flexible neural network models are
		  able to identify important empirical relationships between
		  democracy and conflict that the logit model excludes a
		  priori; this should not be surprising since the logit model
		  is merely a limiting special case of the neural network
		  model.},

  abstract	= {Box-Steffensmeier and Jones (1997) provide a good overview
		  of the class of models known as "event history" or
		  "duration" models, but omit some important points about the
		  relationship between duration dependence and time-varying
		  data in parametric models of duration. The key reason to
		  use duration analysis methods is to allow for the
		  possibility of duration dependence in one's data. However,
		  while assumptions about the form of duration dependence
		  appear to be purely methodological, duration dependence can
		  have important substantive implications for theories of
		  politics. There is often an interaction in estimation
		  between duration dependence and covariates. In particular,
		  duration dependence can be revealed or eliminated when
		  particular time-varying variables are included in or
		  removed from a model. This point is especially important
		  because time-varying covariates are more central and common
		  to important research questions than is sometimes realized.
		  Overall, these points lead to the conclusion that findings
		  about duration dependence go hand-in-hand with proper
		  specification and that model specification both in terms of
		  functional form and included variables must be carefully
		  considered before duration methods are applied.},

@Article{	  benson:2004,
  abstract	= {An important question in the conflict processes literature
		  concerns what types of international relationships are more
		  likely to lead to peaceful interactions. Both security and
		  economic ties have been posited as powerful determinants of
		  conflict, yet their effects are often examined
		  independently from one another. Furthermore, a debate
		  exists as to whether it is states' ties to the
		  international order or to each other that are most
		  important in determining conflict. A resolution of the
		  competing perspectives would expect that two states that
		  have a tight network of security and economic
		  relationships, both to each other and to the international
		  order, should be extremely unlikely to engage in hostile
		  action against each other. Surprisingly, a series of
		  multinomial logits using non-directed dyads from 1951 to
		  1985 suggests that dyads with tight economic and security
		  ties at both the state-to-state and state-to-system levels
		  are only slightly less likely to engage in dyadic disputes
		  than those without such simultaneous ties. However, this
		  study finds that both (1) tight security and economic ties
		  to the international order and (2) tight intra-dyadic
		  security and economic ties have important, independent
		  effects in limiting dyadic hostility. This suggests that
		  the states within a dyad have two separate paths to more
		  peaceful interactions - the first lies in tightening ties
		  between states, the second in strengthening dyadic security
		  and economic ties to the international order.},

		  great deal of attention in the comparative political
		  economy literature. An analysis of the role that indirect
		  taxation plays in the politics of advanced industrial
		  societies is, however, missing. This article demonstrates
		  that a full understanding of the links between
		  redistribution, social democracy and corporatism is
		  impossible without a closer look at indirect taxation.
		  Conventional wisdom is questioned and it is shown that
		  social democratic governments in corporatist environments
		  find themselves in a paradoxical situation. They need to
		  support the welfare state by relying upon a fundamentally
		  regressive policy instrument: indirect taxation. It is also
		  shown that social democratic governments can minimize the
		  use of consumption taxes as part of their redistributive
		  strategy only in non-corporatist settings. In exploring
		  these issues, this article illuminates alternative routes
		  for the pursuit of equality in a context of declining
		  corporatist arrangements.},

@Article{	  box-steffensmeier:zorn:2001a,
  abstract	= {A key assumption of nearly all widely used duration models
		  is that the hazard ratios (i.e., the conditional relative
		  risks across substrata) are proportional to one another and
		  that this proportionality is maintained over time.
		  Estimation of proportional hazards models when hazards are
		  non-proportional results in coefficient biases and
		  decreased power of significance tests. Techniques for
		  relaxing this assumption allow scholars to test whether the
		  effects of covariates change over time and also permit a
		  more nuanced understanding of the phenomenon being studied.
		  We address the potential problems with incorrectly assuming
		  proportionality, illustrate a number of tests for
		  non-proportionality, and conclude with a discussion of how
		  to accurately and efficiently estimate these models in the
		  presence of nonproportional hazards. We investigate the
		  proportionality assumption for Cox's semiparametric model
		  in the context of the "liberal peace" debate, using data on
		  international conflict in the postwar period.},

		  repeatability: nearly all political events reoccur, and
		  theories of learning, path dependence, and institutional
		  change all suggest that later events will differ from
		  earlier ones. Yet, most models for event history analysis
		  fail to account for repeated events, a fact that can yield
		  misleading results in practice. We present a class of
		  duration models for analyzing repeated events, discuss
		  their properties and implementation, and offer
		  recommendations for their use by applied researchers. We
		  illustrate these methods through an application to widely

		  Bivariate analyses of these seven factors in relation to
		  the onset of interstate war over all pairs of states in the
		  period from 1816 to 1965 generally support these
		  associations. However, multivariate analyses reveal some
		  differences. In order of declining importance, the

		  are: presence of contiguity, absence of alliance, absence
		  of more advanced economy, absence of democratic polity,
		  absence of overwhelming preponderance, and presence of
		  major power. Taken together these findings suggest that our
		  research priorities may be seriously distorted and that the
		  idealist prescription for peace may be better than the

		  type and alliance behavior, is examined to test two central
		  hypotheses: democracies are more likely to ally with each
		  other, and states of any similar regime type are more
		  likely to ally with each other. These hypotheses emerge
		  from three theories: constructivism, economic
		  interdependence, and credible commitments. The authors use
		  a data set of all pairs of states from 1816 to 1992.
		  Results show that states with similar regime type are more
		  likely to ally with each other after 1945, although two
		  democracies are not more likely to ally than two
		  autocracies during this period, and distance, learning,
		  threat, and common culture affect alliance behavior, but
		  trade does not. Results indicate sharp limits to the
		  connection between democracy and international cooperation.

  abstract	= {The authors draw on Klinenberg's (2002) ethnography and
		  recent neighborhood theory to explain community-level
		  variation in mortality during the July 1995 Chicago heat
		  wave. They examine the impact of neighborhood structural
		  disadvantage on heat wave mortality and consider three
		  possible intervening mechanisms: social network
		  interaction, collective efficacy, and commercial
		  conditions. Combining Census and mortality data with the
		  1995 Project on Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods
		  Community Survey and Systematic Social Observation, the
		  authors estimate hierarchical Poisson models of death rates
		  both during the 1995 heat wave and comparable, temporally
		  proximate July weeks (1990-94, 1996). They find that
		  neighborhood affluence was negatively associated with heat
		  wave mortality. Consistent with Klinenberg's ethnographic
		  study of the Chicago heat wave, commercial decline was
		  positively associated with heat wave mortality and explains
		  the affluence effect. Where commercial decline was low,
		  neighborhoods were largely protected from heat-related
		  mortality. Although social network interaction and
		  collective efficacy did not influence heat wave mortality,
		  collective efficacy was negatively associated with
		  mortality during comparable July weeks (when no heat wave
		  occurred). Unequal distribution of community-based
		  resources had important implications for geographic
		  differences in survival rates during the Chicago heat wave,
		  and may be relevant for other disasters.},

		  provides social capital. Opinion and behavior are more
		  homogeneous within than between groups, so people connected
		  across groups are more familiar with alternative ways of
		  thinking and behaving. Brokerage across the structural
		  holes between groups provides a vision of options otherwise
		  unseen, which is the mechanism by which brokerage becomes
		  social capital. I review evidence consistent with the
		  hypothesis, then look at the networks around managers in a
		  large American electronics company. The organization is
		  rife with structural holes, and brokerage has its expected
		  correlates. Compensation, positive performance evaluations,
		  promotions, and good ideas are disproportionately in the
		  hands of people whose networks span structural holes. The
		  between-group brokers are more likely to express ideas,
		  less likely to have ideas dismissed, and more likely to
		  have ideas evaluated as valuable. I close with implications
		  for creativity and structural change. },

		  overlooked in political scholarship-and threat perceptions
		  mediate the relationship between exposure to terrorism and
		  attitudes toward minorities. To test the model, a
		  representative sample of 469 Israeli Jewish respondents was

		  Structural Equation Modeling indicated that exposure to
		  terrorism predicted psychological distress (t1), which
		  predicted perceived threat from Palestinian citizens of
		  Israel (t2), which, in turn, predicted exclusionist
		  attitudes toward Palestinian citizens of Israel (t3). These
		  findings provide solid evidence and a mechanism for the

  abstract	= {Many empirical studies have found that disputes over
		  territory are central to the outbreak and intensity of the
		  majority of interstate military conflict. However, the
		  existing literature lacks an explicit theoretical link
		  between the role territory plays in disputes and the
		  outbreak of violence as well as an exploration of how the
		  control of territory is related to conventional military
		  capabilities. This article demonstrates that the targets of
		  territorial claims can consolidate their control over
		  disputed territory to improve their ability to fight
		  effectively on it. The empirical analysis suggests that
		  when territory is strategically located, target states are
		  more likely to consolidate their position, while challenger
		  states are less likely to escalate militarily. Furthermore,
		  when the presence of territorial characteristics such as
		  strategic location makes consolidation an effective
		  strategy, target states are increasingly likely to
		  consolidate as they face stronger opponents.},

		  they use previous administrative frontiers to solve a
		  difficult short-term bargaining problem and a long-term
		  coordination problem. With a unique new set of data
		  collected specifically for this project, we systematically
		  examine the new international borders of the twentieth
		  century resulting from secession, partition, and the use of
		  force. New international borders, we find, are drawn not
		  according to principles of ``nationalism'' or defensible
		  borders, but rather according to previous administrative
		  frontiers. How borders are drawn has important consequences
		  for international stability: borders drawn along previously
		  existing internal or external administrative frontiers
		  experience fewer future territorial disputes and have a
		  much lower risk of militarized confrontation if a dispute

		  Accordingly, states will, from time to time, take assertive
		  measures to secure the border, with among the most
		  aggressive strategies being the construction of physical
		  barriers, which we refer to as ``border walls.'' Using
		  original data on man-made border wall construction from
		  1800 to 2014, we theorize and find that in many cases, wall
		  construction is about economic security. Significant
		  economic disparities between the states will create
		  incentives to illegally transport people or move goods
		  readily available in the poorer country but highly
		  regulated in the richer country. We find that economic
		  disparities have a substantial and significant impact on
		  the presence of a physical wall that is independent of
		  formal border disputes and concerns over instability from
		  civil wars in neighbors. In other words, ``prominent
		  examples such as the Maginot Line'', constructed largely
		  out of fear of attack, is an exception, not the exemplar,
		  of the reasons states construct border walls.},

		  understanding of how the democratic peace unfolds as a
		  historical process in time and space. Whereas most of the
		  conventional literature interprets the phenomenon as a
		  constant and universal law operating at the state level,
		  the author follows Immanuel Kant and treats democratic
		  cooperation as an emergent macroprocess. The current study
		  explores three causal mechanisms. First, strategic tagging
		  introduces a way for democracies to select out like-minded
		  cooperators. Second, regime-sensitive alliances enable
		  democratic states to defend the gains of cooperation.
		  Third, liberal collective security complements the liberal
		  alignments. Based on these processes, it is possible to
		  "grow" cooperative outcomes in an inhospitable geopolitical
		  environment. Because tagging alone is insufficient,
		  alliances, and sometimes even collective security, are
		  necessary to produce perpetual peace. Such outcomes are
		  characterized by high levels of spatial clustering. },

		  succeeded in demonstrating its empirical value--documenting
		  a new and important causal role for norms and social
		  structure in global politics. Theoretically, however, the
		  approach remains underspecified. In particular,
		  constructivists typically fail to explain the origins of
		  such structures, how they change over time, how their
		  effects vary cross nationally, or the mechanisms through
		  which they constitute states and individuals. Missing is
		  the substantive theory and attention to agency that will
		  provide answers to such puzzles, as well as ensure the
		  development of a productive research program.},

  abstract	= {How should one measure political regimes?
		  
		  three goals for a measurement of regimes: 1. should serve
		  to address important research questions 2. can be
		  interpreted meaningfully 3. should be reproducible
		  
		  Cheibub and Gandhi propose a sixfold classification of
		  regimes 3 for democracies 3 for autocracies
		  
		  dichotomous meausre of democracy vs. autocracy
		  
		  how to classify regime as dem vs. dict: 1. is the chief
		  exec. elected? 2. is the legisl. elected? 3. is there more
		  than one party competing in elect? 4. alternation in power
		  under the same electoral rule? => important examples Japan
		  and Botswana
		  
		  if ruling party changed, then country a democracy in all
		  these years that were under the same electoral laws as the
		  elections when the change occured
		  
		  other measures: polity VI and Freedom House what is the
		  conception of democracy? minimalistic (DD) or greater
		  minimalist conception good for most theoretical arguments
		  if FH or Polity is used as indep var, one might not know
		  what of the many influencing variables in FH and Polity
		  explains the variance in the dep. var
		  
		  Data: Polity and FH very hard to reproduce, because data
		  very hard to get at not even completely clear where the
		  data comes from and often subjective in coding (FH)
		  
		  Type of measurement: what is it worth to have a scale from
		  with that many points? does it make sense that gov't change
		  from -7 to -5 many of the countries are at the extremes
		  anyways, only the questionable DD cases are in the middle
		  categories that's the reason for the high correlation - but
		  therefore it does still make a difference which measurement
		  is used, because of the middle cases
		  
		  coding of democracies: three types: parliamentary,
		  presidential and mixed democracies
		  
		  1. is there an independently (either directly or
		  indirectly) elected president? 2. is the executive
		  responsible to the leg? 3. Is the gov't responsible to the
		  president - coding done by the rules of the constition not
		  the actual use of the rules
		  
		  Coding of dictatorships:
		  
		  three kinds: monarchy, military dictators, civilian rulers
		  
		  1. who is the effective leader? 2. Does the head of
		  government bear the title of "king" and have a hereditary
		  successor and/or predecessor? 3. Is the head of government
		  a current or past member of the military? if 2 and 3 no
		  then civilian dictator
		  
		  does not make any assumptions about behavior of dictators,
		  can thus be used for theory testing },

		  Kant--military manpower system--is indeed connected to
		  involvement in militarized interstate disputes during the

  abstract	= {Otherwise powerful, formidable democracies are tempting
		  targets for international violence because they have
		  leaders who, on average, have been in office for shorter
		  periods of time than leaders of autocracies. Domestic
		  incentives may make resistance more costly than offering
		  concessions for inexperienced leaders of both democratic
		  and authoritarian states. Over time, however, resistance
		  may become domestically less costly, causing experienced
		  leaders to be more likely to prefer resistance.
		  Anticipating this response, potential challengers may be
		  more likely to target inexperienced leaders. Because
		  democracies generally have high rates of leadership
		  turnover, they are tempting targets for international
		  violence. Statistical analysis of crisis initiation between
		  1918 and 1992 confirms the perception that democracies are
		  more likely to be targets of militarized challenges.
		  Results are also consistent with the proposition that the
		  relatively short tenure in office served by democratic
		  leaders helps to account for the observed pattern of
		  democratic attraction of foreign challenges. },

		  variables. The justification for these bloated
		  specifications is usually the fear of omitted variable
		  bias. A key underlying assumption is that the danger posed
		  by omitted variable bias can be ameliorated by the
		  inclusion of relevant control variables. Unfortunately, as
		  this article demonstrates, there is nothing in the
		  mathematics of regression analysis that supports this
		  conclusion. The inclusion of additional control variables
		  may increase or decrease the bias, and we cannot know for

@Article{	  collier_levitsky1997,
  abstract	= {trade-off between increasing analitical differentiation
		  and conceptual validity
		  
		  two goals: 1. make the structure of conceptual innovation
		  regarding democracy more comprehensible 2. examine
		  trade-offs among these strategies
		  
		  -scholars should be more careful in the definition and use
		  of concepts
		  
		  Satori's strategy: -concept of the ladder, conceptual
		  differentiation by moving down the ladder, generalization
		  moving up, root concept in the middle -but moving up the
		  ladder, to avoid concept stretching leads to a loss of
		  conceptual differentiation
		  
		  Diminished Subtypes: -diminished subtypes not full
		  instances of the root definition -example: limited-suffrage
		  democracy -identifying specific aspects of the root
		  definition that are missing, while the rest is present
		  -diminished subtypes are always related to the root
		  definition
		  
		  Precising the definition of democracy: -can be seen as
		  raising the standard, yet also as adapting the definition
		  to a new context -precising can be useful, but it modifies
		  the definition itself -"definition gerrymandering" - new
		  definition everytime we encounter something unusual
		  
		  Shifting the overarching concept: from regime to democratic
		  government, or democratic state creating additional
		  analytical categories, example: Brazil as a democratic
		  gov't but not a democratic regime or state
		  
		  Conclusion: diminishing subtypes useful for hybrid regimes,
		  but should they be called ...-democracy precising
		  definitions can be helpful, but danger of definition
		  gerrymandering raising standards can allow new analytical
		  issues
		  
		  problem of confusion and miscomunication, also
		  non-comparability of concepts },

  abstract	= {For decades, scholars have wrestled with the assumption
		  that old age is characterized by social isolation. However,
		  there has been no systematic, nationally representative
		  evaluation of this possibility in terms of social network
		  connectedness. In this article, we develop a profile of
		  older adults' social integration with respect to nine
		  dimensions of interpersonal networks and voluntary
		  associations. We use new data from the National Social
		  Life, Health, and Aging Project (NSHAP), a population-based
		  study of non-institutionalized older Americans ages 57 to
		  85, conducted in 2005 to 2006. Results suggest that among
		  older adults, age is negatively related to network size,
		  closeness to network members, and number of
		  non-primary-group ties. On the other hand, age is
		  positively related to frequency of socializing with
		  neighbors, religious participation, and volunteering. In
		  addition, age has a U-shaped relationship with volume of
		  contact with network members. These findings are
		  inconsistent with the view that old age has a universal
		  negative influence on social connectedness. Instead,
		  life-course factors have divergent consequences for
		  different forms of social connectedness. Indeed, some later
		  life transitions, such as retirement and bereavement, may
		  prompt greater connectedness. We conclude by urging
		  increased dialogue between social gerontological and social
		  network research.},

  abstract	= {ABSTRACT Beck, King, and Zeng (2000) offer both a sweeping
		  critique of the quantitative security studies field and a
		  bold new direction for future research. Despite important
		  strengths in their work, we take issue with three aspects
		  of their research: (1) the substance of the logit model
		  they compare to their neural network, (2) the standards
		  they use for assessing forecasts, and (3) the theoretical
		  and model-building implications of the nonparametric
		  approach represented by neural networks. We replicate and
		  extend their analysis by estimating a more complete logit
		  model and comparing it both to a neural network and to a
		  linear discriminant analysis. Our work reveals that neural
		  networks do not perform substantially better than either
		  the logit or the linear discriminant estimators. Given this
		  result, we argue that more traditional approaches should be
		  relied upon due to their enhanced ability to test
		  hypotheses.},

		  policies of subordinate states in asymmetrical dyads. In
		  this theory, the interaction of two conditions--the state
		  of a nation's economy and the extent of concentration in
		  its linkages with a superordinate power--is used to explain
		  the foreign policy actions of the subordinate state toward
		  the superordiuate country. Directed dyads are divided into
		  asymmetrical and nonasymmetrical sets, and the hypotheses
		  are tested over both sets via regression analysis. The
		  findings confirm the importance of structural asymmetry as
		  a scope condition on the theory but offer only limited
		  support for the use of the economic strength and linkage
		  concentration variables in the explanation of foreign
		  policy. The results also reveal that the influence of these
		  two variables on foreign policy is not precisely as
		  stipulated by the theory. For the more developed African
		  states, relative economic strength in combination with
		  highly concentrated linkages is associated, contrary to the
		  theory, with a foreign policy of expanded relations with
		  superordinate partners. For the less-developed states, this
		  combination produces a foreign policy designed to restrict
		  relations within the asymmetrical dyad as predicted by the
		  theory.},

		  may change because they become more similar to prevailing
		  nearby cultures, are subject to intrinsic random changes,
		  or expand to previously empty cells. Extending Axelrod's
		  (1997) results, the authors show that assimilation does not
		  lead to a single homogeneous culture even if, unlike in
		  Axelrod's model, cultural assimilation may take place even
		  between neighboring cells with zero similarity; intrinsic
		  changes decrease rather than increase the number of stable
		  cultural regions; and expansion of a single culture in a
		  previously unoccupied territory does not result in a single
		  culture in the entire territory. Geographical features
		  (such as mountains) that are an obstacle to contact between
		  cells increase the number of different cultural regions. },

  abstract	= {Empirical studies on trade and conflict generally make use
		  of highly aggregated data. There are, however, good
		  theoretical arguments to suspect that trade in some goods
		  should have a bigger impact on the likelihood of conflict
		  than trade in others. This article examines the
		  relationship between trade and conflict at a lower level of
		  aggregation. It discusses various theoretical arguments why
		  the relationship between trade and conflict should vary
		  across industry sectors, particularly strategic trade,
		  asset specificity, and possible appropriation of gains from
		  trade. The central hypotheses are tested using dyadic
		  United Nations trade data disaggregated at industry level
		  from 1970 to 1997. The main findings are that trade
		  generally reduces the likelihood of conflict, the
		  relationship is weaker for commodities that are more easily
		  appropriable by force, and the relationship is generally
		  stronger for manufactured goods with the notable exceptions
		  of chemical and metal industries and the high-technology
		  sector. },

  abstract	= {Relevant dyads are pairs of contiguous states or pairs of
		  states including at least one major power. They are argued
		  to be the population of dyads at risk of international
		  conflict and are increasingly commonly used as the cases
		  analyzed by conflict researchers. Does reliance on relevant
		  dyads (a nonrandom sample of all dyads) introduce threats
		  to valid inference? The authors argue that relevant dyad
		  usage might introduce related problems of measurement error
		  and selection bias and investigate whether there is
		  evidence of such potential problems existing in actual
		  relevant dyad data sets. Results show evidence for both
		  types of potential problems, but neither problem
		  substantively affects estimates of conflict relationships.
		  Therefore, relevant dyad usage is not especially
		  objectionable due to either of these problems, and
		  retrospective sampling might be an even more profitable
		  course for future research. },

		  specific degree of international commitment available to

		  three dimensions of a triangle whose area is the "political

		  these propositions with an extensive data set of 124
		  post-World War II civil wars and find that multilateral,
		  United Nations peace operations make a positive difference.
		  UN peacekeeping is positively correlated with
		  democratization processes after civil war, and multilateral
		  enforcement operations are usually successful in ending the
		  violence. Our study provides broad guidelines for designing
		  the appropriate peacebuilding strategy, given the mix of
		  hostility, local capacities, and international

		  a concept of a federal union with ts commitment to an

		  failure rate of bicommunal configurations points also to
		  the necessity to relate the inner working of bicommunal

  abstract	= {Using time-series procedures, the authors investigate
		  whether transnational terrorism changed following 9/11 and
		  the subsequent U.S.-led "war on terror." Perhaps
		  surprising, little has changed in the time series of
		  overall incidents and most of its component series. When
		  9/11 is prejudged as a break date, the authors find that
		  logistically complex hostage-taking events have fallen as a
		  proportion of all events, while logistically simple, but
		  deadly, bombings have increased as a proportion of deadly
		  incidents. These results hold when they apply the
		  Bai-Perron procedure in which structural breaks are data
		  identified. This procedure locates earlier breaks in the
		  mid-1970s and 1990s. Reasonable out-of-sample forecasts are
		  possible if structural breaks are incorporated fairly
		  rapidly into the model.},

		  signaling substantially refines and revises this claim. Due
		  to selection effects arising from strategic behavior,
		  measures of the relative strength of a defender's interests
		  that are available before a crisis begins (ex ante) should
		  be related to the failure of the defender's threats during
		  the crisis. Ex ante measures of the defender's relative
		  military strength should correlate with the success of the
		  defender's crisis threats, but due to strategic dynamics
		  that are not grasped by the standard arguments. A
		  reanalysis of Huth and Russett's data on immediate
		  deterrent threats lends support for these and other
		  hypotheses drawn from the game-theoretic treatment.},

		  exist negotiated settlements that genuinely rational states
		  would mutually prefer to a risky and costly fight. Popular
		  rationalist and realist explanations for war fail either to
		  address or to explain adequately what would prevent leaders
		  from locating a less costly bargain. Essentially just two
		  mechanisms can resolve this puzzle on strictly rationalist
		  terms. The first turns on the fact that states have both
		  private information about capabilities and resolve and the
		  incentive to misrepresent it. The second turns on the fact
		  that in specific strategic contexts states may be unable
		  credibly to commit to uphold a mutually preferable bargain.
		  Historical examples suggest that both mechanisms are
		  empirically plausible.},

		  of internal war is mainly the result of a steady
		  accumulation of protracted conflicts since the 1950s and
		  1960s rather than a sudden change associated with a new,
		  post-Cold War international system. We also find that after
		  controlling for per capita income, more ethnically or
		  religiously diverse countries have been no more likely to
		  experience significant civil violence in this period. We
		  argue for understanding civil war in this period in terms
		  of insurgency or rural guerrilla warfare, a particular form
		  of military practice that can be harnessed to diverse
		  political agendas. The factors that explain which countries
		  have been at risk for civil war are not their ethnic or
		  religious characteristics but rather the conditions that
		  favor insurgency. These include poverty-which marks
		  financially and bureaucratically weak states and also
		  favors rebel recruitment-political instability, rough

  abstract	= {It is common for scholars interested in race and poverty
		  to invoke a lack of access to job networks as one of the
		  reasons that African Americans and Hispanics face
		  difficulties in the labor market. Much research has found,
		  however, that minorities do worse when they use personal
		  networks in job finding. Research in this area has been
		  hampered by the complicated and multi-step nature of the
		  job-finding process and by the lack of appropriate
		  comparison data for demonstrating the various ways in which
		  minorities can be isolated from good job opportunities. We
		  seek to specify what it means to say that minorities are
		  cut off from job networks. Building on the literature on
		  social networks in the labor market, we delineate the
		  various mechanisms by which minorities can be isolated from
		  good job opportunities. We examine how these mechanisms
		  operate, using unique data on the chain of network contacts
		  that funnel to an employer offering desirable jobs. We find
		  that network factors operate at several stages of the
		  recruitment process. We find scant evidence, however, that
		  these network factors serve to cut off minorities from
		  employment in this setting. We conclude with a discussion
		  of the theoretical and methodological implications of the
		  case for the study of networks, race, and hiring.},

		  what are the conditions under which property rights are

		  means, 77% favored partial or complete reprivatization
		  
		  What is the original sign argument?
		  
		  - manner in which property is first transferred from state
		  to private hands influences the legitimacy of pro rights
		  
		  but what did coase say about that? ``Ronald Coase, they

		  is relatively unimportant provided that rightholders can
		  exchange their rights in the marketplace''
		  
		  Good use as good works: ``If a manager has modernized and

		  the property rights as legitimate even if the assets were
		  obtained by cutting legal corners.''
		  
		  Public goods as good works:''The public goods version of

		  geographically proximate nation-states. The data base
		  consists of thirty dyadic interstate wars during the period
		  1816-1965. The analysis employs four indicators of national
		  power: geographical area, population, fuel consumption, and
		  steel production. Hypotheses are tested using the
		  Kolmogorov-Smirnov one-sample test. The proximity
		  hypothesis is confirmed (p&lt;.01). The power parity
		  hypothesis is partially confirmed; except for the steel
		  production analysis, all results are in the predicted
		  direction. The population hypothesis is confirmed
		  (p&lt;.025), and there is considerable support for the
		  geographical area hypothesis (p&lt;.10). The findings
		  justify further dyadic and nondyadic analyses and an effort
		  to develop a power parity theory of interstate war.},

  abstract	= {The relationship between static and dynamic power
		  distributions and war is a central element in the realist
		  literature of international politics. The distribution of
		  power and shifts in these distributions are held to be a
		  principal source of conflict in works from Thucydides to
		  Waltz. Most attempts to test empirically for a structural
		  association between capability distributions and conflict
		  have treated disputes as independent events; however, over
		  the last two centuries a disproportionate amount of
		  interstate conflict has occurred in the context of extended
		  dyadic rivalries. This study focuses on the conflict
		  patterns of these "enduring rivals." Based on a Markov
		  chain analysis of 456 militarized disputes occurring
		  between 1816 and 1986, the findings indicate that power
		  parity and shifts toward parity are approximately twice as
		  likely to be associated with war as is a condition of power
		  preponderance. By definition, rival dyads have issues in
		  conflict. Equality of power or shifts toward equality
		  create a situation in which both sides can perceive the
		  potential for successful use of force. The findings
		  generated in this analysis indicate that with such power
		  distributions war between rival nations is most probable.},

  abstract	= {Otherwise powerful, formidable democracies are tempting
		  targets for international violence because they have
		  leaders who, on average, have been in office for shorter
		  periods of time than leaders of autocracies. Domestic
		  incentives may make resistance more costly than offering
		  concessions for inexperienced leaders of both democratic
		  and authoritarian states. Over time, however, resistance
		  may become domestically less costly, causing experienced
		  leaders to be more likely to prefer resistance.
		  Anticipating this response, potential challengers may be
		  more likely to target inexperienced leaders. Because
		  democracies generally have high rates of leadership
		  turnover, they are tempting targets for international
		  violence. Statistical analysis of crisis initiation between
		  1918 and 1992 confirms the perception that democracies are
		  more likely to be targets of militarized challenges.
		  Results are also consistent with the proposition that the
		  relatively short tenure in office served by democratic
		  leaders helps to account for the observed pattern of
		  democratic attraction of foreign challenges. },

  abstract	= {AbstractThe devastating civil war that began in Syria in
		  March 2011 is the result of complex interrelated factors.
		  The focus of the conflict is regime change, but the

		  sociopolitical factors, the erosion of the economic health
		  of the country, a wave of political reform sweeping over
		  the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) and Levant region,
		  and challenges associated with climate variability and
		  change and the availability and use of freshwater. As
		  described here, water and climatic conditions have played a
		  direct role in the deterioration of Syria?s economic
		  conditions. There is a long history of conflicts over water
		  in these regions because of the natural water scarcity, the
		  early development of irrigated agriculture, and complex
		  religious and ethnic diversity. In recent years, there has
		  been an increase in incidences of water-related violence
		  around the world at the subnational level attributable to
		  the role that water plays in development disputes and
		  economic activities. Because conflicts are rarely, if ever,
		  attributable to single causes, conflict analysis and
		  concomitant efforts at reducing the risks of conflict must
		  consider a multitude of complex relationships and
		  contributing factors. This paper assesses the complicated
		  connections between water and conflict in Syria, looks more
		  broadly at future climate-related risks for water systems,

		  (measured by participation in joint extra-curricular

		  While preference predicts friendship choice in the freshman
		  year, propinquity remains the strongest determinant of

		  great power behaviors reflect bureaucratic routine or
		  reciprocity. Recently, some have suggested that these
		  behaviors result from great powers' rational expectations
		  rather than from simple routine or reciprocity. The debate
		  is flawed in several respects. The quasi-experimental
		  studies of great power behavior suffer from specification
		  and measurement errors. Furthermore, most studies of great
		  power behavior focus exclusively on the superpowers,
		  without adequately appreciating China's role in world
		  politics. We present an improved analysis that recognizes
		  the potential effects of Chinese behavior and ameliorates
		  the methodological flaws in existing work. The results
		  indicate that the behaviors of the United States, the
		  Soviet Union, and China are a relatively stable mix of
		  bureaucratic routine and reciprocity. The results also
		  indicate complex, asymmetrical connections among
		  U.S.-Soviet, U.S.-Chinese, and Soviet-Chinese relations,
		  consistent with the notion of a strategic triangle.},

@Article{	  gourevitch:1978,
  abstract	= {The international system is not only an expression of
		  domestic structures, but a cause of them. Two schools of
		  analysis exploring the impact of the international system
		  upon domestic politics (regime types, institutions,
		  coalitions, policies) may be distinguished: those which
		  stress the international economy, and those which stress
		  political-military rivalry, or war. Among the former are
		  such arguments as: late industrialization (associated with
		  Gershenkron); dependencia or core-periphery arguments
		  (Wallerstein); liberal development model (much American
		  writing in the 50s and 60s); transnational
		  relation-modernization (Nye, Keohane, Morse);
		  neo-mercantilists (Gilpin); state-centered Marxists
		  (Schurmann). Arguments stressing the role of war include
		  those which focus on the organizational requirements of
		  providing security (Hintze, Anderson), the special nature
		  of foreign relations (classical political theory),
		  territorial compensation (diplomatic history), and strains
		  of foreign involvement (analysis of revolutions). These
		  arguments provide the basis for criticism of much of the
		  literature which uses domestic structure as an explanation
		  of foreign policy, in particular those which (such as the
		  strong-state weak-state distinction) tend, by excessive
		  focus on forms, to obscure the connection between
		  structures and interests, and the role of politics. These
		  arguments also permit criticism of the notion of a recent
		  fundamental discontinuity in the nature of international
		  relations.},

		  biased estimates of regression coefficients and their

		  consequences of pooling for models of militarized disputes

		  allow for stable but unobserved differences among dyads,
		  the results are altered in fundamental ways.},

		  The paper shows that the game-theoretic notion of
		  self-enforcing equilibrium and the historical
		  institutionalist focus on process are both inadequate to
		  answer these questions. Building on a game-theoretic
		  foundation, but responding to the critique of it by
		  historical institutionalists, the paper introduces the
		  concepts of quasi-parameters and self reinforcement. With
		  these concepts, and building on repeated game theory, a
		  dynamic approach to institutions is offered, one that can
		  account for endogenous change (and stability) of
		  institutions. Contextual accounts of formal governing
		  institutions in early modern Europe and the informal
		  institution of cleavage structure in the contemporary world
		  provide illustrations of the approach.},

  abstract	= {Empirical studies on trade and conflict generally make use
		  of highly aggregated data. There are, however, good
		  theoretical arguments to suspect that trade in some goods
		  should have a bigger impact on the likelihood of conflict
		  than trade in others. This article examines the
		  relationship between trade and conflict at a lower level of
		  aggregation. It discusses various theoretical arguments why
		  the relationship between trade and conflict should vary
		  across industry sectors, particularly strategic trade,
		  asset specificity, and possible appropriation of gains from
		  trade. The central hypotheses are tested using dyadic
		  United Nations trade data disaggregated at industry level
		  from 1970 to 1997. The main findings are that trade
		  generally reduces the likelihood of conflict, the
		  relationship is weaker for commodities that are more easily
		  appropriable by force, and the relationship is generally
		  stronger for manufactured goods with the notable exceptions
		  of chemical and metal industries and the high-technology
		  sector. },

		  required for the trade bond to reduce the probability of
		  interstate conflict. This measure is better suited to study
		  this question than existing measures since it is by
		  definition uncorrelated with asymmetries in country size.
		  The relationship between the different conceptions of
		  interdependence and militarized conflict is explored in an
		  expected utility model of trade, distribution of resources,
		  and conflict. For the particular pacifying mechanisms of
		  trade studied here, the model supports the view that trade
		  reduces the incentives for conflict but that this effect is

  abstract	= { This study examines whether structural properties of
		  friendship networks condition the association between
		  friends' delinquency and an individual's own delinquent
		  behavior. Data from the Add Health allows a more accurate
		  conceptualization of the peer network and a more rigorous
		  measurement of peer delinquency than previous research.
		  Findings from this study indicate that friends' delinquency
		  is associated with an adolescent's own delinquency
		  involvement. However, characteristics of adolescents'
		  friendship networks, such as its density and adolescents'
		  centrality and popularity, condition the delinquency-peer
		  association. Network density, in particular, emerges as an
		  important component of the delinquency-peer association,
		  with very cohesive networks containing stronger
		  delinquency-peer associations than those that are less
		  cohesive. These findings suggest that it is necessary to
		  consider the underlying structural properties of friendship
		  networks in order to understand the impact of peer
		  influence on adolescent delinquency. },

  abstract	= {S.132:
		  
		  Reproduktivit{\"a}t der Steuer: "Denn der
		  Wert{\"u}bertragung steht kein spezieller empfangener
		  Gegenwert gegen{\"u}ber, es wird nicht separat nach dem
		  Grundsatz der speziellen Entgeltlichkeit abgerechnet. Die
		  generelle Entgeltlichkeit liegt vielmehr in den
		  gro{\ss}enteils immateriellen und imponderabilen Leistungen
		  des Staats und in der mittelbaren F{\"o}rderung der
		  Einzelinteressen {\"u}ber den Umweg der Gesamtinteressen.
		  Die Einzelwirtschaften empfangen Vorteile aus allen
		  Wechselbeziehungen zur Gemeinwirtschaft. Die mit den
		  Steuern hergestellten Leistungen und errichteten oder
		  unterhaltennen Anstalten m{\"u}ssen die nationale
		  Gesamtarbeit und ihre Produktivit{\"a}t befruchten und
		  indirekt die Lebensinteressen des einzelnen Besteuerten
		  f{\"o}rdern. Sie entiwckeln reproduktiv die Produktion und
		  das gesamte Wirtschaftsleben. Wir k{\"o}nnen daher von
		  einer relativen Reproduktivit{\"a}t der Steuer sprechen. In
		  je h{\"o}herm Grade aber die Reproduktion wiederbelebend
		  wirkt, desto mehr k{\"o}nnen die Steuern ausgedehnt
		  erweitert und verst{\"a}rkt werden. Wo aber diese
		  reproduktive Wirkung fehlt, wo das Wirtschaftsleben aus den
		  Staatst{\"a}tigkeiten keine neuen, fruchtbringenden
		  Anregungen empf{\"a}ngt, da wird die Steuerlaast zum
		  Steuerdruck, zur l{\"a}hmenden {\"U}berlastung der
		  Erwerbslebens, wozu sich dann erfahrungsgem{\"a}{\ss} eine
		  h{\"o}chst ungerechte und ungleichm{\"a}{\ss}ige
		  Steuerverteilung mit starker Benachteiligung der unteren
		  Klassen zu gesellen pflegt."
		  
		  S.153 Wie alle eink{\"u}nfte eines Wirtschaftsbetribes
		  gewisse Ausgaben oder Kosten des Betriebs verursachen, so
		  ist dies auch der Fall bei der Finanzwirtschaft und im
		  Steuerwesen. Auch hier handelt es sich zun{\"a}chst um
		  Rohertr{\"a}ge, die erst nach Abzug der Betriebs
		  aufwendungen sich in Reinertr{\"a}ge verwandeln. Der
		  Staatsaufwand umfa{\ss}t daher zwei Gruppen von Ausgaben,
		  die Betriebs- und Er hebungskosten der einzelnen
		  Einnahmezweige einer- und die eigent lichen
		  Staatsverwaltungsausgaben andererseits. Nur die
		  Reinertr{\"a}ge der Besteuerung sind somit zur Bestreitung
		  der Staatsausgaben verf{\"u}gbar. Im Interesse der
		  Staatsverwaltung liegt es daher, einen m{\"o}glichst hohen
		  Reinertrag aus den Steuern zu erzielen und die
		  Erhebungskosten m{\"o}glichst einzuschr{\"a}nken. Wir haben
		  es des halb im wesentlichen zu tun mit einer Anwendung des
		  „{\"o}konomi schen Prinzips" oder des „Prinzips der
		  Wirtschaftlichkeit" auf das Steuerwesen, um mit
		  m{\"o}glichst geringen Opfern an Kosten, m{\"o}glichst viel
		  Erfolg an Einkommen zu erzielen. Denn je mehr es gelingt,
		  jene in ihrer H{\"o}he zu reduzieren, desto ausgiebiger
		  k{\"o}nnen die Kollektivbed{\"u}rfnisse befriedigt werden.
		  Der Staat mu{\ss} in dieser Hin sicht nach den gleichen
		  Erw{\"a}gungen verfahren wie jede andere Einzelwirtschaft.
		  Die Erhebungkosten sind am h{\"o}chsten bei den Z{\"o}llen
		  und Verbrauchssteuern, die einen komplizierten,
		  kostspieligen Verwaltungsorganismus und zahlreiche
		  Kontroll- und {\"U}berwachungs beh{\"o}rden notwendig
		  machen. Dagegen sind sie geringer bei den direkten Steuern,
		  namentlich wenn der Staat die Gemeinden auch mit der
		  Erhebung der Staatssteuern betraut. (...) Die Entwickelung
		  dieser Zahlungsmethoden ist aber in den meisten Staaten
		  noch gering.
		  
		  S.160 Die volkswirtschaftliche Wertung und die
		  einzelwirtschaftliche Wirkung der Steuer h{\"a}ngt
		  demgem{\"a}{\ss} von den {\"o}konomisch-technischen und
		  sozialen Reflexen ab, die jene G{\"u}ter- und
		  Wert{\"u}bertragungen von den Einzelwirtschaften auf die
		  Kollektivwirtschaften hervorrufen. Sie werden allerdings
		  meist mittelbarer und immaterieller Art sein. Die Grenzen
		  der Be steuerung liegen eben, wie schon a. a. 0.
		  nachgewiesen wurde (s. o. I {\S} 3), in ihrer relativen
		  Reproduktion. Ma{\ss} und Methode der Benutzung des
		  Steuerfonds ist damit durch den Grad der {\"U}ber
		  schu{\ss}erzeugung bedingt, in dem eine solche {\"u}ber den
		  natio nalen Kr{\"a}fte- und Wertverbrauch m{\"o}glich ist.
		  Je mehr es gelingt, so {\"U}bersch{\"u}sse zu
		  reproduzieren, desto st{\"a}rker kann auch die An spannung
		  der Besteuerung sein. Wenn aber ein Mi{\ss}verh{\"a}ltnis
		  zwischen dieser und jenen eintritt, dann ist die Grenze der
		  Steuer leistungsf{\"a}higkeit erreicht. Jedes Mehr an
		  Belastung bedeutet ein Weniger an wirtschaftlicher
		  Produktivkraft, wodurch zuerst eine Stagnation und sodann
		  ein allm{\"a}hliges Einschlafen der nationalen Kr{\"a}fte
		  herbeigef{\"u}hrt wird, das die V{\"o}lker zwingt, sich mit
		  dem Notwendigsten in ihrer Finanzwirtschaft zu bescheiden.
		  Sie werden zu Greisen unter den V{\"o}lkern und siechen
		  dahin.
		  
		  S.164 Die Mittel liegen aber mehr auf dem Boden einer
		  mittelbaren Pr{\"a}vention als in der unmittelbaren
		  Repression. Sie k{\"o}nnen bestehen in der Ausdehnung der
		  Staatst{\"a}tigkeiten auch auf dem Gebiete der materiellen
		  Produktion, in der Erwerbung wichtiger Anlagen und
		  Kapitalien durch den Staat (Bergwerke!), in der Schaffung
		  gesamtheitlicher Organisationen zur Eind{\"a}mmung der
		  individuellen Interessen zugunsten der Gemeinschaft und end
		  lich in der Bef{\"o}rderung aller Organbildung, die
		  zwischen den Ex tremen des Besitzes und der Besitzlosigkeit
		  leistungsf{\"a}hige Zwischen glieder schafft. {\"U}berall
		  handelt es sich nicht darum, Vorhandenes in seiner
		  Entwickelung durch Gewalt zu hemmen, sondern korrelative
		  Institute ins Leben zu rufen, die einen erg{\"a}nzenden
		  oder ersetzen den Ausgleich begr{\"u}nden. Ein brutaler
		  Eingriff in die Verteilung des Volksverm{\"o}gens und
		  Volkseinkommens vermittelst der Besteuerung mu{\ss} nach dem Gesagten dem Wesen der Steuer fremd bleiben. 1) },

		  The relationship between the different conceptions of

  abstract	= {Coherent democracies and harshly authoritarian states have
		  few civil wars, and intermediate regimes are the most
		  conflict-prone. Domestic violence also seems to be
		  associated with political change, whether toward greater
		  democracy or greater autocracy. Is the greater violence of
		  intermediate regimes equivalent to the finding that states
		  in political transition experience more violence? If both
		  level of democracy and political change are relevant, to
		  what extent is civil violence related to each? Based on an
		  analysis of the period 1816-1992, we conclude that
		  intermediate regimes are most prone to civil war, even when
		  they have had time to stabilize from a regime change. In
		  the long run, since intermediate regimes are less stable
		  than autocracies, which in turn are less stable than
		  democracies, durable democracy is the most probable
		  end-point of the democratization process. The democratic
		  civil peace is not only more just than the autocratic peace
		  but also more stable.},

		  results are not robust or replicable across studies.
		  Studies use different definitions of civil war and analyze
		  different time periods, so readers cannot easily determine
		  if differences in empirical results are due to those
		  factors or if most empirical results are just not robust.
		  The authors apply a methodology for organized specification
		  tests to check the robustness of empirical results. They
		  isolate causes of variation in empirical results by using
		  the same definition of civil war and analyzing the same
		  time period while systematically exploring the sensitivity
		  of eighty-eight variables used to explain civil war in the
		  literature. Several relationships with the onset of civil
		  wars prove robust: large population and low income levels,
		  low rates of economic growth, recent political instability
		  and inconsistent democratic institutions, small military
		  establishments and rough terrain, and war-prone and
		  undemocratic neighbors. Variables representing ethnic
		  difference in the population are robust only in relation to
		  lower level armed conflict.},

  abstract	= {Recent research on representational linkages between
		  legislators and their constituents challenges the
		  long-standing assumption that constituency preferences are
		  exogenous to the linkage process, but does not clearly
		  suggest the conditions under which a specific pattern of
		  linkage should exist. Drawing on a diverse collection of
		  prior research, we argue that issues that function as main
		  lines of cleavage between competing political parties
		  should be characterized by reciprocal linkages between mass
		  and elite preferences, while highly complex issues on which
		  party distinctions are unclear should be characterized by
		  no linkages between mass and elite. For salient issues on
		  which the public fails to distinguish party positions, we
		  expect the traditional one-way linkage from mass to elite.
		  We test our theoretical expectations with a unique version
		  of the data from the 1958 American Representation Study-and
		  with explicit predictions for which policy issues addressed
		  in that study should demonstrate which particular pattern
		  of mass-elite linkage. The empirical results, derived from
		  LISREL analyses for three policy areas, are entirely in
		  accord with our predictions.},

  abstract	= {Domestic political conflict has been a constant companion
		  to international trade, but the nature of that conflict has
		  varied greatly in Western democracies over the last two
		  centuries. Political battles over trade policy appear to
		  have sometimes divided societies along broad class lines
		  and at other times split them into narrow industry-based
		  coalitions. I argue that this diversity stems from
		  historical and cross-national variation in inter-industry
		  factor mobility. Class coalitions are more likely where
		  factor mobility is high, whereas narrow, industry-based
		  coalitions are more likely where mobility is low. Evidence
		  from six Western economies for the last two centuries
		  indicates that levels of factor mobility have varied
		  historically and cross-nationally in accord with
		  industrialization and regulation. This variation
		  corresponds broadly with observable differences in the
		  formation of trade policy coalitions.},

  abstract	= {Applications of modern methods for analyzing data with
		  missing values, based primarily on multiple imputation,
		  have in the last half-decade become common in American
		  politics and political behavior. Scholars in these fields
		  have thus increasingly avoided the biases and
		  inefficiencies caused by ad hoc methods like listwise
		  deletion and best guess imputation. However, researchers in
		  much of comparative politics and international relations,
		  and others with similar data, have been unable to do the
		  same because the best available imputation methods work
		  poorly with the time-series cross-section data structures
		  common in these fields. We attempt to rectify this
		  situation. First, we build a multiple imputation model that
		  allows smooth time trends, shifts across cross-sectional
		  units, and correlations over time and space, resulting in
		  far more accurate imputations. Second, we build
		  nonignorable missingness models by enabling analysts to
		  incorporate knowledge from area studies experts via priors
		  on individual missing cell values, rather than on
		  difficult-to-interpret model parameters. Third, since these
		  tasks could not be accomplished within existing imputation
		  algorithms, in that they cannot handle as many variables as
		  needed even in the simpler cross-sectional data for which
		  they were designed, we also develop a new algorithm that
		  substantially expands the range of computationally feasible
		  data types and sizes for which multiple imputation can be
		  used. These developments also made it possible to implement
		  the methods introduced here in freely available open source
		  software that is considerably more reliable than existing
		  strategies.},

		  these individual-level processes are shown to be
		  conditioned by constraints imposed due to the distribution
		  of political preferences in the social context. Thus,
		  individual control over socially supplied political
		  information is partial and incomplete. Finally, these

		  quick and decisive victory on the battlefield enhances
		  deterrence; (2) a policy of reciprocity in diplomacy and
		  military actions by the defender contributes strongly to
		  deterrence success; and (3) a past record of backing down
		  under pressure or intransigence in confrontations with the
		  potential attacker increases the likelihood of deterrence

  abstract	= {ABSTRACT In this article, we explain the role of
		  international law in the resolution of territorial disputes
		  from 1945 to 2000. In doing so, we focus on three outcomes
		  of interest. First, when do states choose to revise the
		  territorial status quo through negotiations instead of
		  force? Second, when are states able to reach a final
		  settlement? Third, when do states prefer a process of legal
		  dispute resolution (i.e., adjudication or arbitration) to
		  bilateral negotiations? To answer these questions, we argue
		  that when the legal principles relevant to the dispute are
		  unambiguous and clearly favor one side, a law-based focal
		  point will emerge. This focal point, in turn, facilitates
		  the settlement process by helping leaders overcome
		  distribution problems, a central obstacle in reaching a
		  final agreement. We find strong and consistent empirical
		  support for our hypotheses regarding international law and
		  peaceful dispute resolution.},

  abstract	= {General deterrence, unlike immediate deterrence, has
		  rarely been analyzed in a systematic comparative manner. We
		  outline a research design for doing so, by studying the
		  circumstances under which, in a set of enduring rivalries,
		  challengers are likely to initiate militarized disputes. We
		  indicate the conceptual and operational steps necessary to
		  make and empirically compare predictions stemming from
		  three often-competing theoretical frameworks: rational
		  deterrence, a general model of rational conflict
		  initiation, and a cognitive psychological model of behavior
		  emphasizing risk orientation and misperception. The results
		  of probit analysis on a pooled time series of enduring
		  rivalries since 1945 provide support for hypotheses from
		  each of the different theoretical models.},

  abstract	= {Secession is an attempt to resolve a domestically based
		  territorial dispute by dividing a country's homeland
		  territory into new, secessionist (e.g., Eritrea) and rump
		  (e.g., Ethiopia) states. Yet, the secession may not have
		  resolved the original dispute to the states' satisfaction.
		  In the aftermath of a secession, the leader of the rump
		  state is motivated to use force by the benefits of retaking
		  (some of) the land lost to the secessionist state, while
		  the secessionist state's leader is motivated by the
		  benefits of acquiring even more land. The peaceful versus
		  violent secession process further affects whether these
		  desires escalate into the use of force. The results--based
		  on the examination of the consequences of all
		  twentieth-century secessions--reveal that ethnically based
		  territorial disputes play a much greater role in conflict
		  onset than do their economically or strategically based
		  counterparts and that peaceful secessions lead to peaceful
		  relations. },

  abstract	= {A key assumption of nearly all widely used duration models
		  is that the hazard ratios (i.e., the conditional relative
		  risks across substrata) are proportional to one another and
		  that this proportionality is maintained over time.
		  Estimation of proportional hazards models when hazards are
		  non-proportional results in coefficient biases and
		  decreased power of significance tests. Techniques for
		  relaxing this assumption allow scholars to test whether the
		  effects of covariates change over time and also permit a
		  more nuanced understanding of the phenomenon being studied.
		  We address the potential problems with incorrectly assuming
		  proportionality, illustrate a number of tests for
		  non-proportionality, and conclude with a discussion of how
		  to accurately and efficiently estimate these models in the
		  presence of nonproportional hazards. We investigate the
		  proportionality assumption for Cox's semiparametric model
		  in the context of the "liberal peace" debate, using data on
		  international conflict in the postwar period.},

		  negotiations? and (2) Does the impact of mediation vary in
		  accordance with mediator style? Data are drawn from the
		  International Crisis Behavior data set and from ongoing
		  experimental work with human subjects. The historical data
		  reveal that mediated crises are more typically
		  characterized by compromise among crisis actors, are more
		  likely to end in agreements, and show a tendency toward
		  long-term tension reduction. The experimental research
		  confirmed the relationship between mediation and the
		  achievement of agreement and also revealed that mediation
		  leads to crises of shorter duration and to greater
		  satisfaction by the parties with the outcome. A
		  manipulative mediation style is more likely to yield
		  favorable crisis management outcomes than is a more
		  restrictive facilitative style. },

		  factors are systematically included in the analysis. The
		  paper's first part groups the recent literature into three
		  paradigms which distinguish between three international
		  effects. The second part offers a comparison of the
		  differences between a state-centered policy network in
		  France and a society-centered network in the United States.
		  The third part of the paper combines the arguments of the
		  first two and analyzes French and American commercial,
		  financial, and energy policies as the outcome of both
		  international effects and domestic structures. These case
		  studies show that domestic factors must be included in an
		  analysis of foreign economic policies. The paper's main
		  results are analyzed further in its fourth part.},

@Article{	  king2001,
  abstract	= {This article offers the first independent scholarly
		  evaluation of the claims, forecasts, and causal inferences
		  of the State Failure Task Force and its efforts to forecast
		  when states will fail. State failure refers to the collapse
		  of the authority of the central government to impose order,
		  as in civil wars, revolutionary wars, genocides,
		  politicides, and adverse or disruptive regime transitions.
		  States that sponsor terrorism or allow it to be organized
		  within their borders are all failed states. This task
		  force, set up at the behest of Vice President Gore in 1994,
		  has been led by a group of distinguished academics working
		  as consultants to the U.S. CIA. State Failure Task Force
		  reports and publications have received attention in the
		  media, in academia, and from public decision makers. The
		  article identifies several methodological errors in the
		  task force work that cause its reported forecast
		  probabilities of conflict to be too large, its causal
		  inferences to be biased in unpredictable directions, and
		  its claims of forecasting performance to be exaggerated.
		  However, the article also finds that the task force has
		  amassed the best and most carefully collected data on state
		  failure to date, and the required corrections provided in
		  this article, although very large in effect, are easy to
		  implement. The article also demonstrates how to improve
		  forecasting performance to levels significantly greater
		  than even corrected versions of its models. Although the
		  matter is still a highly uncertain endeavor, the authors
		  are nevertheless able to offer the first accurate forecasts
		  of state failure, along with procedures and results that
		  may be of practical use in informing foreign policy
		  decision making. The article also describes a number of
		  strong empirical regularities that may help in ascertaining
		  the causes of state failure.},

  abstract	= {This article offers the first independent scholarly
		  evaluation of the claims, forecasts, and causal inferences
		  of the State Failure Task Force and its efforts to forecast
		  when states will fail. State failure refers to the collapse
		  of the authority of the central government to impose order,
		  as in civil wars, revolutionary wars, genocides,
		  politicides, and adverse or disruptive regime transitions.
		  States that sponsor terrorism or allow it to be organized
		  within their borders are all failed states. This task
		  force, set up at the behest of Vice President Gore in 1994,
		  has been led by a group of distinguished academics working
		  as consultants to the U.S. CIA. State Failure Task Force
		  reports and publications have received attention in the
		  media, in academia, and from public decision makers. The
		  article identifies several methodological errors in the
		  task force work that cause its reported forecast
		  probabilities of conflict to be too large, its causal
		  inferences to be biased in unpredictable directions, and
		  its claims of forecasting performance to be exaggerated.
		  However, the article also finds that the task force has
		  amassed the best and most carefully collected data on state
		  failure to date, and the required corrections provided in
		  this article, although very large in effect, are easy to
		  implement. The article also demonstrates how to improve
		  forecasting performance to levels significantly greater
		  than even corrected versions of its models. Although the
		  matter is still a highly uncertain endeavor, the authors
		  are nevertheless able to offer the first accurate forecasts
		  of state failure, along with procedures and results that
		  may be of practical use in informing foreign policy
		  decision making. The article also describes a number of
		  strong empirical regularities that may help in ascertaining
		  the causes of state failure.},

  abstract	= {Over the past ten years or so there has been renewed
		  research interest in the relative impact of peer selection
		  and peer influence on the increasing similarity of
		  teenagers in their substance use. Researchers have
		  concluded that either peer selection or peer influence
		  explained the similarity. This paper examines this research
		  question differently using complete network data and
		  arrives at different conclusions. Findings emonstrate that
		  similarity in the substance use of teenagers and their
		  peers is explained by either peer selection or peer
		  influence for some, by both peer selection and peer
		  influence for others, and by neither for others. Using a
		  sociological approach and a social network perspective this
		  paper demonstrates how chain reactions result in similarity
		  in the substance use of teenagers in their peer groups, by
		  drawing together those who are similar with those who are
		  not. The paper demonstrates how chain reactions involve
		  peer selection, the patterning of peer ties and peer
		  influence, and explores how gender affects all aspects of
		  the chain reaction process.},

  abstract	= {Electoral institutions influence legislators' constituency
		  size and makeup and, as a result, affect the lens that
		  representatives look through to assess the costs of
		  military conflict. Given the uneven distribution of
		  casualties during a conflict, the costs of international
		  violence vary between constituencies and thus affect
		  representatives differently. The authors develop a
		  constituency-based theory of legislator accountability and
		  legislature behavior that predicts when democracies are
		  willing to pay human costs in an interstate conflict and
		  their likelihood of being involved in a dispute. The
		  results suggest that the more diffuse political
		  account-ability, the less likely a state is to get involved
		  in a militarized dispute, but that once involved, the more
		  likely a state will sustain casualties. The authors'theory
		  suggests that choices over the mechanisms of political
		  representation have far-reaching effects on political
		  accountability and foreign policy. },

  abstract	= {A unique longitudinal and prospective approach is used to
		  analyze the social embeddedness of rural-urban Thai
		  migrants and their subsequent migration. More than any one
		  particular social tie, it is the configuration of social
		  ties at multiple levels that influences whether migrants
		  experience their destination as integrative and a place for
		  settlement or not. Social ties at multiple levels and from
		  multiple sources weave into a social fabric that surrounds
		  migrants in destination contexts, shaping their migration
		  trajectories. The findings show that urban-integrated
		  migrants with diverse social support ties in the urban
		  destination who reside in village enclaves and households
		  that promote social adaptation and incorporation tend to be
		  found again in urban destinations 6 years later. By
		  comparison, semi-integrated and urban-isolated migrants
		  whose social support ties, community structures, and
		  households provide relatively weak links and support within
		  the urban setting exhibit stronger tendencies to return to
		  their villages of origin or to migrate onward from their
		  initial destination. The findings suggest that migrants'
		  mobility pathways-whether they settle in their current
		  destination, return to their villages of origin, or make
		  additional movements onward-depend on the organization of

  abstract	= {The structure of international trade, identified by the

		  explained by a state-power theory of international
		  political economy. This theory begins with the assumption
		  that the nature of international economic movements is
		  determined by states acting to maximize national goals.
		  Four goals--aggregate national income, political power,
		  social stability, and economic growth--can be
		  systematically related to the degree of openness in the
		  international trading system for states of different
		  relative sizes and levels of development. This analysis
		  leads to the conclusion that openness is most likely to
		  exist when there is a hegemonic distribution of potential
		  economic power. Time-series data on tariff levels, trade
		  proportions, regional concentration, per capita income,
		  national income, share of world trade, and share of world
		  investment are then presented. The first three are used to
		  describe the degree of openness in the trading system; the
		  last four, the distribution of state power. The data
		  suggest that the state-power theory should be amended to
		  take into consideration domestic political constraints on
		  state action.},

@Article{	  krause1997,
  abstract	= {Theory: It is argued here that previous studies analyzing
		  the formation of voters' economic expectations overlook
		  important subtleties found in a differentiated
		  (heterogeneous) electorate. Since different segments of the
		  electorate possess varying information capabilities, it is
		  asserted that they will form their prospective economic
		  evaluations differently from one another. Hypotheses: The
		  impact of "expectational" electoral cycles, news coverage
		  of the economy reported by voters, retrospective economic
		  evaluations, and personal financial expectations are
		  hypothesized to have a differential impact on their
		  economic expectations based on varying levels of
		  information (education) among subsets of the electorate.
		  Methods: Time series multiple regression analysis is
		  conducted for the monthly period between January 1978 and
		  December 1990. The empirical analysis involves testing for
		  the properties of the statistical time series (i.e.,
		  integration and cointegration) as well as specification of
		  an error correction mechanism (ECM) that captures long-run
		  statistical relationships in appropriate circumstances.
		  Results: These findings uncover electoral heterogeneity
		  (based on information/education differences) with respect
		  to voters' prospective economic evaluations. Specifically,
		  the information capabilities of voters is inversely related
		  to their reliance on past/retrospective sources of
		  information when forming both egocentric and sociotropic
		  economic expectations. The main implication of this
		  research is that the assumption of electoral homogeneity
		  contained in previous longitudinal analyses of aggregate
		  economic opinion formation provides misleading results that
		  either overlook intra-electoral variations, introduce
		  aggregation bias, or possibly both.},

		  data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent
		  Health to test if (1) type of sport and (2) peer athletic

		  fighting. Contrary to social control expectations, analyses
		  suggest that athletic involvement fails to inhibit male

		  wrestlers, as opposed to baseball, basketball, tennis, and
		  other athletes, are significantly more likely than
		  nonathletic males to be involved in a serious fight.
		  Additionally, the direct effect of football is explained by
		  the football participation of individuals' peers. Males
		  whose friends play football are more likely to fight than
		  other males, supporting perspectives that emphasize peer
		  contexts as important mediators. Overall, findings are
		  consistent with the expectations of social learning and

		  likely to ally with each other. These hypotheses emerge
		  from three theories: constructivism, economic

		  a data set of all pairs of states from 1816 to 1992.
		  Results show that states with similar regime type are more

		  democracies are not more likely to ally than two
		  autocracies during this period, and distance, learning,
		  threat, and common culture affect alliance behavior, but
		  trade does not. Results indicate sharp limits to the
		  connection between democracy and international cooperation.

		  understanding of how the democratic peace unfolds as a
		  historical process in time and space. Whereas most of the
		  conventional literature interprets the phenomenon as a
		  constant and universal law operating at the state level,
		  the author follows Immanuel Kant and treats democratic
		  cooperation as an emergent macroprocess. The current study
		  explores three causal mechanisms. First, strategic tagging
		  introduces a way for democracies to select out like-minded
		  cooperators. Second, regime-sensitive alliances enable
		  democratic states to defend the gains of cooperation.
		  Third, liberal collective security complements the liberal
		  alignments. Based on these processes, it is possible to
		  "grow" cooperative outcomes in an inhospitable geopolitical
		  environment. Because tagging alone is insufficient,
		  alliances, and sometimes even collective security, are
		  necessary to produce perpetual peace. Such outcomes are
		  characterized by high levels of spatial clustering. },

		  theoretical questions relating to the stability of the
		  status quo in international politics, deterrence,
		  bargaining, and preventive war. I then raise conceptual and
		  methodological problems which complicate the theoretical
		  and empirical application of prospect theory to
		  international behavior. I illustrate my arguments with
		  references to some recent attempts to use a prospect theory
		  framework to guide case studies of crises decision-making.
		  I conclude that in applying prospect theory to empirical
		  cases, the analyst must demonstrate not only that empirical
		  behavior is consistent with the theory but also that the
		  observed behavior cannot adequately be explained by a
		  rational choice model which posits the maximization of
		  expected value.},

		  elections which provides true forecasts-it "calls" the seat
		  change well in advance of the election itself. The model
		  predicts seat change as a function of both quarterly real
		  GNP per capita growth and presidential popularity measured
		  six months prior to the election, plus the time of the
		  election (midterm or not). This model is more attractive
		  than the earlier, strictly midterm, models propounded by
		  Tufte and Hibbs. It is clearly superior in forecasting the
		  1982 results. In general, the model's forecasts for postwar
		  House races are very close to the actual result, off only
		  five or six seats at the median, regardless of whether the
		  forecast is made ex post or ex ante. As a final exercise,
		  we apply the model to 1984, in order to forecast the
		  prospective Republican House seat change.},

		  economic performance, international involvement, political
		  experience, and presidential popularity, we go on to

		  at a time conditional on all the others, is a popular
		  technique that can be convenient and flexible, as it
		  replaces a potentially difficult multivariate modelling
		  problem with relatively simple univariate regressions. In
		  this paper, we begin to characterize the stationary
		  distributions of iterative imputations and their
		  statistical properties, accounting for the conditional
		  models being iteratively estimated from data rather than
		  being prespecified. When the families of conditional models
		  are compatible, we provide sufficient conditions under
		  which the imputation distribution converges in total
		  variation to the posterior distribution of a Bayesian
		  model. When the conditional models are incompatible but
		  valid, we show that the combined imputation estimator is
		  consistent.},

@Article{	  lizardo:2006,
  abstract	= {This article examines the relationship between different
		  forms of cultural taste and the density of social contacts
		  across alternative types of network relations classified by
		  average tie strength. The author builds on Bourdieu's
		  ([1986] 2001) classic statement on the "forms of capital"
		  (economic, social, and cultural) and the conversion
		  dynamics among them, and on DiMaggio's (1987) connection
		  between cultural tastes and sociability. He hypothesizes
		  that (1) in addition to cultural tastes being determined by
		  network relations, cultural tastes are used to form and
		  sustain those networks. Furthermore he expects that (2)
		  highbrow culture taste will be less likely to be converted
		  into social capital beyond immediate strong-tie circles due
		  to its more restricted, "asset-specific" nature. Because of
		  its generalized appeal, taste for popular culture will be
		  more likely to be associated with weak-tie network density.
		  The results broadly support these hypotheses: a model that
		  specifies an effect of culture on network density provides
		  a better fit to the data than the traditional conception of
		  networks as determining taste. In addition using log-linear
		  models and instrumental-variable methods, I show that
		  popular culture consumption has a positive impact on
		  weak-tie network density but not strong-tie network
		  density, while highbrow culture consumption selectively
		  increases strong-tie density but has no appreciable effect
		  on weak ties, net of standard socioeconomic variables.
		  These findings help to shed light on the mechanisms that
		  translate mastery of different types of cultural knowledge
		  into integration across distant social positions or closure
		  around strong group boundaries. The author also discusses
		  the implications of the results for current models
		  describing the transformation of cultural into social
		  resources.},

  abstract	= {The aim of this paper is to understand the interrelations
		  among relations within concrete social groups. Social
		  structure is sought, not ideal types, although the latter
		  are relevant to interrelations among relations. From a
		  detailed social network, patterns of global relations can
		  be extracted, within which classes of equivalently
		  positioned individuals are delineated. The global patterns
		  are derived algebraically through a 'functorial' mapping of
		  the original pattern. Such a mapping (essentially a
		  generalized homomorphism) allows systematically for
		  concatenation of effects through the network. The notion of
		  functorial mapping is of central importance in the 'theory
		  of categories,' a branch of modem algebra with numerous
		  applications to algebra, topology, logic. The paper
		  contains analyses of two social networks, exemplifying this
		  approach. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

		  insurgent attacks? To date, most existing theories and
		  empirical studies have concluded that such violence is
		  highly counterproductive because it creates new grievances
		  while forcing victims to seek security, if not safety, in
		  rebel arms. This proposition is tested using Russian
		  artillery fire in Chechnya (2000 to 2005) to estimate
		  indiscriminate violence's effect on subsequent patterns of
		  insurgent attacks across matched pairs of similar shelled
		  and nonshelled villages. The findings are counterintuitive.
		  Shelled villages experience a 24 percent reduction in
		  posttreatment mean insurgent attacks relative to control
		  villages. In addition, commonly cited "triggers" for
		  insurgent retaliation, including the lethality and
		  destructiveness of indiscriminate violence, are either
		  negatively correlated with insurgent attacks or
		  statistically insignificant.},

		  provides an excellent description of the cross-country
		  data. The paper also examines the implications of the Solow
		  model for convergence in standards of living, that is, for

  abstract	= {The concept of international affinity--albeit under
		  different names--captures a central place in international
		  relations research. This study examines how different types
		  of affinity affect the likelihood of conflict between
		  states. The authors discuss different types of affinities
		  as these appear in the realist and liberal paradigms. They
		  offer a social networks conception of structural
		  affinity--the concept of structural equivalence--which
		  reflects the similarity of international ties across a set
		  of different networks. They test the hypotheses derived
		  from these paradigms, using both existing measures of
		  affinity and their own structural equivalence measures.
		  Their findings suggest that (1) strategic affinity has a
		  consistent dampening effect on the probability of dyadic
		  conflict, (2) trade-related affinity does consistently
		  affect the probability of dyadic conflict, and (3)
		  intergovernmental organization-related affinity has a
		  negative impact on conflict, mostly in the twentieth
		  century. },

		  regimes have consistently appeared in the pages of
		  International Organization. We review the theoretical and
		  empirical work on international institutions and identify
		  promising directions for the institutionalist research
		  program. Early studies of international institutions were
		  rich with empirical insights and often influenced by
		  theoretical developments in other fields of political
		  science, but lacking an overarching analytical framework
		  they failed to produce a coherent body of scholarship.
		  Current efforts to reinvigorate the study of international
		  institutions draw on a new body of theory about domestic
		  institutions. We argue that the assumptions of this new
		  approach to institutions are more appropriate to
		  international studies than those of earlier attempts to
		  transfer theories across levels of analysis. We suggest
		  that the most productive questions for future research will
		  focus on specifying alternative mechanisms by which
		  institutions can influence outcomes and identify particular
		  sets of questions within this agenda that are especially
		  promising.},

  abstract	= {Have the core discussion networks of Americans changed in
		  the past two decades? In 1985, the General Social Survey
		  (GSS) collected the first nationally representative data on
		  the confidants with whom Americans discuss important
		  matters. In the 2004 GSS the authors replicated those
		  questions to assess social change in core network
		  structures. Discussion networks are smaller in 2004 than in
		  1985. The number of people saying there is no one with whom
		  they discuss important matters nearly tripled. The mean
		  network size decreases by about a third (one confidant),
		  from 2.94 in 1985 to 2.08 in 2004. The modal respondent now
		  reports having no confidant; the modal respondent in 1985
		  had three confidants. Both kin and non-kin confidants were
		  lost in the past two decades, but the greater decrease of
		  non-kin ties leads to more confidant networks centered on
		  spouses and parents, with fewer contacts through voluntary
		  associations and neighborhoods. Most people have densely
		  interconnected confidants similar to them. Some changes
		  reflect the changing demographics of the U.S. population.
		  Educational heterogeneity of social ties has decreased,
		  racial heterogeneity has increased. The data may
		  overestimate the number of social isolates, but these
		  shrinking networks reflect an important social change in
		  America},

		  wrong. Although undermining one of these three beliefs is
		  sufficient to undermine the others, I address each

		  models should replace rational models, but that no single
		  approach has a lock on understanding rationality. In some
		  important contexts (such as in strategic choice) or when
		  using certain concepts (such as trust, identity, justice,

  abstract	= {Poliheuristic theory (PH) bridges the gap between
		  cognitive and rational theories of decision making. PH
		  postulates a two-stage decision process. During the first
		  stage, the set of possible options is reduced by applying a
		  "noncompensatory principle" to eliminate any alternative
		  with an unacceptable return on a critical, typically
		  political, decision dimension. Once the choice set has been
		  reduced to alternatives that are acceptable to the decision
		  maker, the process moves to a second stage, during which
		  the decision maker uses more analytic processing in an
		  attempt to minimize risks and maximize benefits. In this
		  article, the author applies poliheuristic theory to
		  individual, sequential, and interactive decision settings.
		  Subsequent articles in this issue offer theoretical
		  extensions and multiple tests of the theory using multiple
		  methods (formal, statistical, experimental).},

  abstract	= {Economic and organizational sociologists have increasingly
		  demonstrated that the actions of individuals and firms are
		  affected by the social networks within which they are
		  embedded. In recent years scholars have begun to recognize
		  that the effects of these social networks may vary across
		  populations or types of relations. This article examines
		  the extent to which the effects of interfirm networks on
		  the behavior of firms are historically contingent. Focusing
		  on the level of debt financing among approximately 140
		  large U.S. corporations over a 22-year period, the authors
		  show that the extent to which the firms'use of debt was
		  influenced by those with which they were tied through
		  director interlocks declined over time. The authors argue
		  that this decline in the network effect reflected a shift
		  in the institutional environment within which the firms
		  operated, and that it was driven by three processes: the
		  professionalization of the finance function within the
		  firm, the internalization of financial decision-making, and
		  the increased volatility of the environment. They conclude
		  that corporate financing is socially embedded, but this
		  embeddedness is historically contingent.},

		  In essence, EBMA improves prediction by pooling information
		  from multiple forecast models to generate ensemble
		  predictions similar to a weighted average of component
		  forecasts. The weight assigned to each forecast is
		  calibrated via its performance in some validation period.
		  The aim is not to choose some {\`O}best{\'O} model, but
		  rather to incorporate the insights and knowledge implicit
		  in various forecasting efforts via statistical
		  postprocessing. After presenting the method, we show that
		  EBMA increases the accuracy of out-of-sample forecasts
		  relative to component models in three applied examples:
		  predicting the occurrence of insurgencies around the
		  Pacific Rim, forecasting vote shares in U.S. presidential
		  elections, and predicting the votes of U.S. Supreme Court
		  Justices.},

		  network. The results show that participation in the
		  sociology collaboration network depends on research
		  specialty and that quantitative work is more likely to be
		  coauthored than non-quantitative work. However, structural
		  embeddedness within the network core given collaboration is
		  largely unrelated to specialty area. This pattern is

  abstract	= {A model is introduced that yields a single parsimonious
		  explanation for a diverse range of political phenomena,
		  including the processes of democratic consolidation and
		  peace among democratic nations. The model predicts
		  democratic values to arise from the norms of contract that
		  are endemic in developed market economies and yields the
		  novel contingent claim that the peace among democratic
		  nations may be a pattern limited to those democracies with
		  developed economies. Analyses of a large number of
		  interstate dyads from 1950 to 1992 show strong support for
		  this hypothesis. It seems that the pacifying impact of
		  democracy is about twice as strong among developed
		  countries compared with other dyads. Among conflict-prone
		  contiguous dyads, the pacifying impact of democracy does
		  not appear statistically significant among the poorest
		  decile of joint democratic dyads. The study demonstrates
		  the wide explanatory power of the simple postulate that
		  social values and political preferences derive from
		  socioeconomic norms. },

		  violence has identified important economic and political
		  determinants of civil war. That literature has treated
		  civil war as an aggregate category and has not considered
		  if identity (ethnic/religious) wars have different causes
		  than nonidentity wars. The author argues that this is an
		  important distinction and that identity wars are due
		  predominantly to political grievance rather than lack of
		  economic opportunity. Ethnic heterogeneity is also
		  associated differently with identity than nonidentity wars.
		  Some systemic variables are also important determinants of
		  civil war, and these have been neglected in the existing
		  literature. An important new result is that living in a bad
		  neighborhood, with undemocratic neighbors or neighbors at
		  war, significantly increases a country's risk of
		  experiencing ethnic civil war. },

		  transition whose beginning is not the consequence - direct
		  or indirect - of important divisions within the
		  authoritarian regime itself, principally along the
		  fluctuating cleavage between hard-liners and soft-liners.
		  (brazil and spain cases of such direct causality){\ldots}
		  
		  differentiation of transitions in successful and
		  unsuccesful authoritarian regimes,
		  
		  "where dissent is high and regime self-confidence is low,
		  unless the cost of organizing collectively is raised, the
		  transition will be imposed by a mobilized opposition ."
		  p.21 here the opposition has large influence on subsequent
		  rules, inst.
		  
		  "no transition can be forced purely by opponents against a
		  regime which maintains the cohesion, capacity, and
		  disposition to apply repression. Perpetuation in power or
		  armed revolutionary struggle become the only likely
		  outcomes of such cases" p. 21
		  
		  two key difference: "Nevertheless, the regime-confident,
		  self-initiated scenario differs from the opposition-induced
		  in two key respects: 1) the sequence, rhythm, and scope of
		  liberalization remain more firmly in the control of the
		  incumbents (and, therefore occure more slowly and with less
		  generalized uncertainty); and 2) the social and political
		  forces which supported the authoritarian regime stand a
		  better chance of playing a significant electoral and
		  representational role in the subsequent regime" p.21
		  
		  taking steps during trans. to prevent coups, thus coups
		  rare
		  
		  who is engaged in repression during authoritarian regime is
		  important, i.e. can military claim to have not been
		  involved after transition
		  
		  episodic and incoherent authoritarian reg have done more to
		  undermine institutions of the more or less democratic
		  regime which preceded them than the longer-lived and
		  ideologicall stronger auth regimes
		  
		  coup threat may split the soft liners, but at some point it
		  becomes clear that hard liners would not only have to
		  supress opposition but also part of the softliners
		  
		  violence pre democr, leads to guarantees about post
		  transition security for perpetrators or instability
		  
		  slow transition may be safer, but sequential changes make
		  only marginal and slow transformations in social and
		  economic inequities possible -- but that might be the point

		  there are transposition, refunctionality, and catalysis
		  across multiple social networks. Specifically, political
		  co-optation of cambio bankers in the aftermath of the
		  Ciompi revolt induced the transposition of domestic guild
		  methods to the international plane, thereby changing their
		  purpose and their reach. Subsequent social absorption
		  through marriage of these elevated bankers into the
		  victorious political alliance infused partnership with the
		  multiplex logic (and often money) of dowry, thereby
		  reproducing partnership systems as an integral component in
		  post-Ciompi republicanism. Medieval organizational logics
		  of patrilineage and guild were transformed into Renaissance
		  organizational logics of marriage and clientage. The
		  origins of financial capitalism are partly rooted in this

		  (1997) results, the authors show that assimilation does not
		  lead to a single homogeneous culture even if, unlike in
		  Axelrod's model, cultural assimilation may take place even
		  between neighboring cells with zero similarity; intrinsic
		  changes decrease rather than increase the number of stable
		  cultural regions; and expansion of a single culture in a
		  previously unoccupied territory does not result in a single
		  culture in the entire territory. Geographical features
		  (such as mountains) that are an obstacle to contact between
		  cells increase the number of different cultural regions. },

  abstract	= {This study analyzes foreign policy behavior in the realm
		  of international energy politics. The model we developed
		  states that conflict and cooperation between importers and
		  exporters of oil are related to the development of oil
		  issues by the host countries which are undergoing the
		  process of oil industrialization. Three issue sets are
		  identified and each is related to the foreign policy
		  behavior of the exporters directed toward the western oil
		  importers. The issue sets include (1) development of the
		  emergent oil industries, (2) distribution of the profits
		  therefrom, and (3) the control and ownership of the oil
		  industries. The model depicting aspects of the evolution of
		  oil issues is operationalized utilizing difference
		  equations, and correspondence with event/interaction data
		  is tested for two cases: Iran and Saudi Arabia. Between 53%
		  and 98% of the variance in measured cooperative and
		  conflictual petroleum behavior is explained.},

  abstract	= {We analyse the co-evolution of social networks and
		  substance use behaviour of adolescents and address the
		  problem of separating the effects of homophily and
		  assimilation. Adolescents who prefer friends with the same
		  substance-use behaviour exhibit the homophily principle.
		  Adolescents who adapt their substance use behaviour to
		  match that of their friends display the assimilation
		  principle. We use the Siena software to illustrate the
		  co-evolution of friendship networks, smoking, cannabis use
		  and drinking among sport-active teenagers. Results indicate
		  strong network selection effects occurring with a
		  preference for same sex reciprocated relationships in
		  closed networks. Assimilation occurs among cannabis and
		  alcohol but not tobacco users. Homophily prevails among
		  tobacco and alcohol users. Cannabis use influences smoking
		  behavior positively (i.e., increasing cannabis increases
		  smoking). Weaker effects include drinkers smoking more and
		  cannabis users drinking more. Homophily and assimilation
		  are not significant mechanisms with regard to sporting
		  activity for any substance. There is, however, a
		  significant reduction of sporting activity among smokers.
		  Also, girls engaged in less sport than boys. Some
		  recommendations for health promotion programmes are made.},

  abstract	= {This paper suggests a three-stage procedure for the
		  estimation of time-invariant and rarely changing variables
		  in panel data models with unit effects. The first stage of
		  the proposed estimator runs a fixed-effects model to obtain
		  the unit effects, the second stage breaks down the unit
		  effects into a part explained by the time-invariant and/or
		  rarely changing variables and an error term, and the third
		  stage reestimates the first stage by pooled OLS (with or
		  without autocorrelation correction and with or without
		  panel-corrected SEs) including the time-invariant variables
		  plus the error term of stage 2, which then accounts for the
		  unexplained part of the unit effects. We use Monte Carlo
		  simulations to compare the finite sample properties of our
		  estimator to the finite sample properties of competing
		  estimators. In doing so, we demonstrate that our proposed
		  technique provides the most reliable estimates under a wide
		  variety of specifications common to real world data. },

		  progressivity of the tax structure in the USA and Europe.
		  LIS data allow a comparison of tax rates that attempts to
		  take different starting rates, thresholds and exemptions
		  into account. Our study supports the argument others have
		  made that the USA has more progressive taxes than the
		  European countries. However, we find that Britain's tax
		  structure is more regressive than those of the continental
		  welfare states, making the mapping of tax structure onto
		  the three worlds of welfare' imperfect. We also show that
		  it is a mistake to assume that income and property taxes
		  are always progressive: regressive examples of both are
		  common in the data. But sales taxes are regressive wherever
		  they are found, and we suggest that the proportion of tax
		  revenue raised through sales taxes can serve as an index of
		  overall progressivity in situations where the detailed data
		  examined here are not available. We close by outlining
		  several possible explanations for the inverse correlation
		  between tax progressivity and welfare state effort. },

  abstract	= {The rise in the importance of nonstate actors in
		  generating new norms in world politics has been documented
		  by scholars, but the literature has focused predominantly
		  on nonsecurity ("new") issue areas. Conversely, although
		  recent constructivist work in international relations has
		  examined the security policies of states, typically it is
		  the state that is doing the constrncting of interests. I
		  bridge these two literatures by examining the hard case of
		  transnational civil society working through issue networks
		  to teach state interests in security policy. I analyze the
		  campaign by transnational civil society to generate an
		  international norm prohibiting antipersonnel land mines and
		  trace the effects of several techniques through which
		  states can be said to be socialized. Through generating
		  issues, networking, "grafting," and using a transnational
		  Socratic method to reverse burdens of proof, the campaign
		  has stimulated systemic normative change through two
		  processes: norm adoption through the conversion of
		  persuaded moral entrepreneurs and emulation resulting from
		  social pressures of identity.},

		  short-term relations in the context of long-term "memories"
		  that shape future expectations of their bilateral
		  relations. The results indicate that reciprocity in
		  Indo-Pakistani relations is shaped by a long-term
		  equilibrium and suggest a reconceptualization of the nature
		  of the Indo-Pakistani relations. The findings highlight the
		  legacy of suspicions between these two countries, providing
		  sober insights into the possibilities for reducing conflict

@Article{	  ramirez_boli_1987,
  abstract	= {We show that in some cases, a military defeat or a failure
		  to keep pace with industrial development in rival countries
		  stimulated the state to turn to education as a means of
		  national revitalization to avoid losing power and prestige
		  in the interstate system. In other cases, when a nation
		  moving toward a position of first rank in the system was
		  challenged by rivals attempting to block its rise through
		  military alliances and economic exertions, mass schooling
		  was adopted as a means of achieving more comprehensive
		  mobilization to assure continued success in the system.
		  External challenges of these sorts were important stimuli
		  to state action in education, not least because they
		  exacerbated the costs associated with internal obstacles to
		  national development and success, including such factors as
		  the power of the clergy, state- or class-based privileges,
		  and subunit political autonomy
		  
		  earliest regulation proclaiming universal compulsary
		  education appeared in the German state of Weimar in 1619,
		  
		  PRUSSIA: problem of prussia to create a nation to go along
		  with its state,
		  
		  the institutionalization, however followed a victory in the
		  war against Austria and France, no national polity, 40
		  years later loss to Napoleon France, "Conditions were ripe
		  for Fichte's words to have effect. Almost immediately, a
		  Bureau of Education was established within the Ministry of
		  the Interior; ten years later, a separate Department of
		  Education was created in the Ministry of Religion,
		  Education, and Public Health. Between 1817 and 1825, under
		  the direction of Baron von Altenstein, state administration
		  of education was established (Rowlinson 1974). Taxes were
		  imposed to finance the school system, and every Land was
		  required to establish local primary and folk schools. State
		  certification of primary school teachers and the
		  establishment of state normal schools to provide teacher
		  training followed later (Reisner 1922)."
		  
		  "First, the state attempted to use mass schooling to create
		  a more unified national citizenry and thereby consolidate
		  state power both within the nation and relative to other
		  national states, as enunciated explicitly by Fichte.
		  Second, the union was sparked by a clear challenge to
		  Prussia's position in the European state system- its defeat
		  at the hands of the French after a period during which
		  Prussia had managed gradually to increase its international
		  stature and power. Prussia saw its rise in the European
		  system blocked. Its response was state-controlled

		  SWEDEN: "The ensuing upheaval resulted in a new
		  constitution, and further turmoil and uncertainty led the
		  Swedes to invite Jean Bernadotte, one of Napoleon's
		  generals, to take the throne in 1810. At the same time,
		  bourgeois liberals led a movement to develop mass schooling
		  to provide national unity and purpose. Their efforts were
		  defeated by the reactionary politics of the aristocracy,
		  clergy, and new king and by the unwillingness of the
		  peasantry to foot the bill for an educational system
		  (Jansson 1948)."
		  
		  FRANCE: education under ancien regime, mostly religious
		  schools, education only to the upper middle class, poor
		  were left to philantrophy, Napolean: "Of all political
		  questions, that [of education] is perhaps the most
		  important. There cannot be a firmly established political
		  state unless there is a teaching body with definitely
		  recognized princi- ples. If the child is not taught from
		  infancy that he ought to be a republican or a monarchist, a
		  Catholic or a free-thinker, the state will not constitute a
		  nation; it will rest on uncertain and shifting foundations;
		  and it will be constantly exposed to disorder and change.
		  (Quoted in Reisner 1922, p. 35)" but no real change to
		  increased public education until after the loss in the
		  Franco-Prussian war in 1870, "one popular expression
		  current in France at the time was that the Franco-Prussian
		  War had been "won by the Prussian schoolmaster""
		  
		  ENGLAND: "But events in the 1860s altered the situation.
		  First, further political reform began to enfranchise the
		  working classes (1867), and a new Liberal- Labor alliance
		  argued strongly for compulsory mass education. The full
		  democratization of the political realm was seen as
		  inevitable, and education was increasingly regarded as a
		  means to civilize the lower classes so as to "avoid
		  anarchy" (Robert Lowe's phrase, quoted in Jones [1977, p.
		  50]), i.e., to teach the lower classes proper behavior in
		  the political arena"
		  
		  threat to British world supremacy by the unified US and

		  EUROPE IN GENERAL The typical response encompassed the
		  following elements: declaration of a national interest in
		  mass education, legislation to make schooling compulsory,
		  creation of a state educational ministry or department, and
		  establishment of state authority over existing and new
		  schools.
		  
		  "Trans- forming the masses into national citizens became a
		  standardized feature of the state-orchestrated nation-
		  building process; utilizing state-sponsored mass schooling
		  to achieve this political end became a routinely accepted
		  modus operandi (Ramirez and Boli 1982)."

		  economic development are found to influence conflict

		  satisfaction with the status quo are found to have robust
		  pacifying effects on the onset of conflict, the results
		  suggest that they are unrelated to the escalation of
		  disputes to war. (3) Allied pairs of states appear less
		  likely to escalate their disputes. (4) Finally, the unified
		  model suggests that it is essential for researchers
		  interested in the escalation behavior of states to consider
		  first how states become involved in disputes. Conflict
		  onset and escalation appear to be related processes.},

		  conflict onset can be better understood in the context of
		  "noisy" bargaining. Specifically, trading states bargain
		  under less noisy conditions and, as a result, are unlikely
		  to engage in militarized conflict. Noise is introduced into
		  a generic take-it-or-leave-it bargaining game in the form
		  of nonspecific asymmetric information about the defender's
		  reservation value. Comparative statics show a positive
		  monotonic relationship between variance in the noise term
		  and the onset of militarized conflict. The relationships
		  among economic interdependence, variance in the noise term,
		  and conflict onset are evaluated with a Bayesian
		  heteroskedastic probit model. Historical data are used to
		  demonstrate that interdependence and uncertainty are
		  related to each other and jointly related to the onset of
		  militarized conflict. Uncertainty appears to be reduced by
		  economic interdependence, and this leads to an enhanced
		  probability of agreement short of a militarized clash. },

  abstract	= {Many statistical studies in international relations
		  investigate the claim that democracies do not fight one
		  another. Virtually all of these studies employ a
		  single-equation design, where the dependent variable
		  measures the presence or absence of a dyadic militarized
		  interstate dispute (MID). A separate group of studies
		  argues that conflict affects democracy and that its effect
		  could be positive or negative. By and large, these two
		  bodies of literature have not incorporated one another's
		  insights. We argue that democracy and dyadic conflict
		  affect each other significantly and that statistical models
		  that ignore the reciprocal nature of these effects may make
		  incorrect inferences. To test this argument, we develop a
		  simultaneous equations model of democracy and dyadic
		  conflict. Our sample includes all the politically relevant
		  dyads from 1950 to 1992. We find that dyadic military
		  disputes reduce joint democracy and joint democracy reduces
		  the probability of MIDs. Compared with the single-equation
		  estimates in the literature, the absolute effect of joint
		  democracy in our paper is smaller while in relative terms,
		  the effect is similar in size. The effect of joint
		  democracy on MID involvement is considerably smaller for
		  noncontiguous countries than for contiguous ones. The
		  effects of a number of control variables in the MID
		  equation are also found to differ from those reported
		  previously in single-equation-based studies.},

		  emotions and the etiology of terrorism. Instead, research
		  priorities have tended to focus on the structural (e.g.,
		  poverty; weak and failing states), sociopolitical (e.g.,
		  LIS foreign policy; a "clash of civilizations"), or codal
		  (e.g., madrassas; Wahhabism). The aim here is to outline an
		  agenda which transitions discourse related to the "body" of
		  the terrorist (i.e., his/her historical and social
		  positioning) to one focused on intrapsychic and
		  interpersonal emotional processes. As such, scholarship's
		  predictive and explanatory capacities will be heightened if
		  it adopts a perspective grounded in the emotions of
		  terrorists and their source communities, particularly for
		  those phenomena that suggest a fluidity of movement of
		  actors across a continuum of zealotry. Criminology and
		  criminal justice are well suited to assess the expressive
		  byproducts of humiliated fury, contempt. moral outrage, and
		  disgust and how such emotions may distillate as impulses
		  that form a basis for terror. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All

  abstract	= {Liberal theorists and, more recently, constructivists have
		  argued that a shared sense of identity will decrease threat
		  perception and increase international cooperation. But what
		  processes lead to the emergence (or collapse) of a shared
		  sense of identity? Drawing on individual-level experiments
		  of identity change and societal-level theories of idea
		  diffusion from the constructivist literature, the authors
		  develop an agent-based computer simulation of identity
		  change. Four findings emerge from the analysis: (1) there
		  is a curvilinear relationship between the complexity of
		  agents'views and the emergence of shared identity, (2)
		  highly unstable environments encourage the emergence of a
		  shared identity, (3) the presence of leaders (i.e., agents
		  with greater influence in the population) in the
		  neighborhood decreases shared identity, and (4) the
		  interaction of complexity, stability, and leadership
		  produces extremely polarized societies. },

		  into its own during the past decade, not only as a
		  metatheoretical critique of currently dominant
		  neo-utilitarian approaches (neorealism and neoliberal
		  institutionalism) but increasingly in the form of detailed
		  empirical findings and theoretical insights. Constrnctivism
		  addresses many of the same issues addressed by
		  neo-utilitarianism, though from a different vantage and,
		  therefore, with different effect. It also concerns itself
		  with issues that neo-utilitarianism treats by assumption,
		  discounts, ignores, or simply cannot apprehend within its
		  characteristic ontology and/or epistemology. The
		  constructivist project has sought to open up the relatively
		  narrow theoretical confines of conventional approaches--by
		  pushing them back to problematize the interests and
		  identities of actors; deeper to incorporate the
		  intersubjective bases of social action and social order;
		  and into the dimensions of space and time to establish
		  international structure as contingent practice,
		  constraining social action but also being (re)created and,
		  therefore, potentially transformed by it.},

  abstract	= {This paper examines the robustness of explanatory
		  variables in cross-country economic growth regressions. It
		  introduces and employs a novel approach, Bayesian Averaging
		  of Classical Estimates (BACE), which constructs estimates
		  by averaging OLS coefficients across models. The weights
		  given to individual regressions have a Bayesian
		  justification similar to the Schwarz model selection
		  criterion. Of 67 explanatory variables we find 18 to be
		  significantly and robustly partially correlated with
		  long-term growth and another three variables to be
		  marginally related. The strongest evidence is for the
		  relative price of investment, primary school enrollment,
		  and the initial level of real GDP per capita. (JEL 051,
		  052, 053)
		  
		  In fact, we find that about one-fifth of the 67 variables
		  used in the analysis can be said to be significantly
		  related to growth while several more are marginally
		  related. The strongest evidence is found for primary
		  schooling enrollment, the relative price of investment
		  goods and the initial level of income where the latter
		  reflects the concept of conditional convergence. Other
		  important variables include regional dummies (such as East
		  Asia, Sub- Saharan Africa, or Latin America), some measures
		  of human capital and health (such as life expectancy,
		  proportion of a country lying in the tropics, and malaria
		  prevalence), religious dummies, and some sectoral variables

		  violence has identified important economic and political

		  if identity (ethnic/religious) wars have different causes

		  important distinction and that identity wars are due
		  predominantly to political grievance rather than lack of
		  economic opportunity. Ethnic heterogeneity is also
		  associated differently with identity than nonidentity wars.
		  Some systemic variables are also important determinants of
		  civil war, and these have been neglected in the existing
		  literature. An important new result is that living in a bad

		  war, significantly increases a country's risk of

@Article{	  sambanis_2004,
  abstract	= {The empirical literature on civil war has seen tremendous
		  growth because of the compilation of quantita- tive data
		  sets, but there is no consensus on the measurement of civil
		  war. This increases the risk of making inferences from
		  unstable empirical results. Without ad hoc rules to code
		  its start and end and differentiate it from other violence,
		  it is difficult, if not impossible, to define and measure
		  civil war. A wide range of varia- tion in parameter
		  estimates makes accurate predictions of war onset
		  difficult, and differences in empirical results are greater
		  with respect to war continuation.
		  
		  NOtes: significant differences on "three questions: What
		  threshold of violence distinguishes civil war from other
		  forms of internal armed conflict? How do we know when a
		  civil war starts and ends? How can we distinguish between
		  intrastate, interstate, and extrastate wars? "
		  
		  how to distinguish civil war from other forms of pol
		  violence
		  
		  "1. 2. 3. What level of violence qualifies as civil war?
		  Should this be an absolute or relative level? Should we
		  only count battle deaths or also civilian deaths?"
		  
		  provi- sionally code a war onset at the year that we count
		  100 to 500 deaths and keep the event as a civil war if
		  coders count more than 1,000 deaths in total within 3 years
		  of onset.
		  
		  0.001 threshold for death/population as a benchmark for
		  wars that do not exceed 500-1000 deaths
		  
		  battle deaths vs. total deaths
		  
		  sambanis coding rules: "The war takes place within the
		  territory of a state that is a member of the international
		  sys- tem32 with a population of 500,000 or greater.33 (b)
		  The parties are politically and militarily organized, and
		  they have publicly stated political objectives.34 (c) The
		  government (through its military or militias) must be a
		  principal combatant. If there is no functioning government,
		  then the party representing the government internationally
		  and/or claiming the state domestically must be involved as
		  a combatant.35 (d) The main insurgent organization(s) must
		  be locally represented and must recruit locally. Additional
		  external involvement and recruitment need not imply that
		  the war is not intra- state.36 Insurgent groups may operate
		  from neighboring countries, but they must also have some
		  territorial control (bases) in the civil war country and/or
		  the rebels must reside in the civil war country.37 (e) The
		  start year of the war is the first year that the conflict
		  causes at least 500 to 1,000 deaths.38 If the conflict has
		  not caused 500 deaths or more in the first year, the war
		  iscoded as having started in that year only if cumulative
		  deaths in the next 3 years reach 1,000. (f) Throughout its
		  duration, the conflict must be characterized by sustained
		  violence, at least at the minor or intermediate level.
		  There should be no 3-year period during which the conflict
		  causes fewer than 500 deaths.40 (g) Throughout the war, the
		  weaker party must be able to mount effective resistance.
		  Effec- tive resistance is measured by at least 100 deaths
		  inflicted on the stronger party. A sub- stantial number of
		  these deaths must occur in the first year of the war.41 But
		  if the violence becomes effectively one-sided, even if the
		  aggregate effective-resistance threshold of 100 deaths has
		  already been met, the civil war must be coded as having
		  ended, and a politicide or other form of one-sided violence
		  must be coded as having started.42 (h) A peace treaty that
		  produces at least 6 months of peace marks an end to the
		  war.43 (i) A decisive military victory by the rebels that
		  produces a new regime should mark the end of the war.44
		  Because civil war is understood as an armed conflict
		  against the government, continuing armed conflict against a
		  new government implies a new civil war.45 If the gov-
		  ernment wins the war, a period of peace longer than 6
		  months must persist before we code a new war (see also
		  criterion k). (j) A cease-fire, truce, or simply an end to
		  fighting can also mark the end of a civil war if they
		  result in at least 2 years of peace.46 The period of peace
		  must be longer than what is required in the case of a peace
		  agreement because we do not have clear signals of the par-
		  ties' intent to negotiate an agreement in the case of a
		  truce/cease-fire.47 (k) If new parties enter the war over
		  new issues, a new war onset should be coded, subject to the
		  same operational criteria.48 If the same parties return to
		  war over the same issues, we generally code the
		  continuation of the old war, unless any of the above
		  criteria for coding a war's end apply for the period before
		  the resurgence of fighting. },

  abstract	= {The research presented here addresses a longstanding but
		  previously unsupported theoretical proposition related to
		  social learning in the demographic literature. This is that
		  individuals should respond to lower (higher) infant
		  mortality of socially proximate others with decreased
		  (increased) fertility. On a more general level this problem
		  directly concerns the translation of the effects of
		  macro-demographic forces such as mortality into micro-level
		  individual behavior through social interaction. Using
		  unique data that combine identification of individuals
		  belonging to women's social networks with direct
		  measurement of these network members' mortality experience,
		  this research demonstrates such a linkage. Information
		  concerning the level and variation in infant mortality
		  available to women from a small Nepalese mountain
		  population in their social networks is seen to influence
		  the tempo of their fertility. It is suggested that the
		  methodology employed has important implications for
		  quantitative analyses of reciprocal processes of social
		  construction and micro-macro linkages more generally.},

		  change is perceived by decision-makers as threatening, and,
		  thus, they prepare for and initiate war. Utilizing COW data
		  to establish system share capability and thereby determine
		  velocity of dyadic ratio change prior to the event (war or
		  no war), the hypothesis was tested controlling for
		  contiguity and century. The findings give moderate to
		  strong support to the theory. In general, the trend was in
		  the right direction. In addition, low velocity of change
		  strongly approaches a sufficient condition for peace, and

		  zwischen steuerpflichtiger und steuerfreier
		  Bev{\"o}lkerung, blieb bis weit in das 19. Jahrhundert
		  hinein bestehen. Zwar sollten die Steuerfreiheiten 1811
		  aufgehoben werden, doch setzte sich die allgemeine
		  Steuerpflicht des gutsherrlichen Adels erst 1861, der
		  vormaligen Standesherren 1891 durch."
		  
		  -- hohe Staatseinnahmen aus Staatsbetrieben
		  
		  -- S. 122: " Durch alle Reformen hindurch zeigen die
		  Steuergesetze, wie auch in England und Frankreich, eienin
		  dominanten Grundzug: F{\"o}rderun der Kapitalakumulation
		  und damit des Wirtschaftswachstums. Dabei hei{\ss}t
		  F{\"o}rderung teils aktives Handeln, mehr noch passives
		  Dulden einer Entwicklung, die in diese Richtung weist.
		  [{\ldots}] Der Zusammenhang zwischen den Bereichen
		  Industrialisierung und Sparen, Eigentums- und
		  Verf{\"u}gungsrechte {\"u}ber Sachg{\"u}ter,
		  liberal-orientierte Marktwirtschaft sowie Einkommens- und
		  Verm{\"o}gensverteilung ist angesprochen. Sozialpolitische
		  Gesichtspunkte ber{\"u}cksichtigte die Steuergesetzgebung
		  erst sp{\"a}t und nachranagig."
		  
		  --S.122: "Der Staat wandte sich langfristig von
		  '{\"a}u{\ss}eren T{\"a}tigkeiten' mehr und mehr 'inneren
		  Belangen' zu. Der Ausbau der inneren Verwaltung und der
		  Rechtspflege erbrachte mit der Herstellung und dem
		  instutionalisierten Nutzungsangebot von {\"o}ffentlichen
		  G{\"u}tern und Dienstleistungen einen entscheidenden
		  Beitrag zu den Vorbedingungen und Begleiterfordernissen
		  f{\"u}r die industrielle Entwicklung. Das ist sowohl
		  konkret-materiell zu verstehen, z.B. der Bau einer Schule,
		  als auch im Bereich der Bewusstseinsbildung."
		  
		  --S. 135: "Die Kombination von st{\"a}ndischer
		  Zugeh{\"o}rigkeit und mutma{\ss}licher Einkommensh{\"o}he
		  bei der Steuerbemessung rief vor allem in den gegen{\"u}ber
		  den Ostprovinzen gewerblich weiterentwickelten und
		  st{\"a}rker differenzierten Rheinlanden Unzufriedenheit
		  hervor, wobei offenbar die ungerecht verteilte Steuerlast
		  dr{\"u}ckender Empfunden wurde als die absolute

		  "Die Einsch{\"a}tzung nach {\"a}u{\ss}eren
		  Einkommensmerkmalen in insgesamt 43 Einkommensstufen blieb
		  gleichwohl ungenau, variierte von Regierungsbezirk zu
		  Regierungsbezirk und stand hinter dem in England erreichten
		  zur{\"u}ck. Den Grunds{\"a}tzen der Besteuerung nach der
		  Leistungsf{\"a}higkeit entsprachen beide Steuern kaum."
		  
		  S. 147: "Doch die Gewichte der preu{\ss}ischen Politik
		  waren andere. Mit seinem in den Grundz{\"u}gen
		  unver{\"a}nderten direkten Steuersystem, das a) die
		  Kapitalakkumulation von privaten Unternehmern und
		  Gesellschaften zu Lasten der unteren Einkommensschichten
		  subventionierte und b) die Bereiche Gewerbe, Handel,

		  vollzog sich in Preu{\ss}en die Industrialisierung und
		  f{\"u}hrte das Land an die Spitzengruppe der
		  europ{\"a}ischen Industrinationen heran."
		  
		  S. 161: "Die Gemeinden erhielten zur weitgehenden
		  Eigenverantwortung Kommunalsteuern, Geb{\"u}hren, und
		  Beitr{\"a}ge zugewiesen: die modifizierte Grund- und
		  Geb{\"a}udesteuern, die neu konzipierte Gewerbesteuer und
		  die Bergwerksabgaben. Die Gemeindeordnungen regelten Art
		  und H{\"o}he der Geb{\"u}hren und Beitr{\"a}ge, die die
		  Gemeinden f{\"u}r die von ihnen bereitgestellten G{\"u}ter
		  und Dienstleistungen erheben konnten. Die weitgehende
		  Selbstst{\"a}ndigkeit der Gemeinden bei der

		  Aufgaben im Bildungswesen ({\ldots}), im Wohlfahrtswesen
		  ({\ldots}), im Bereich der Infrastruktur ({\ldots}) und im
		  Bereich der unteren Verwaltung ({\ldots})."
		  
		  S. 197: "Allem Anschein nach waren auch die

		  Personalbezsteuerund steuerlich beg{\"u}nstigt. Diese
		  Personen hattten die M{\"o}glichkeit, private und

		  dadurch ein, zus{\"a}tzliches, nicht oder gering
		  besteuertes Kapitalzinseinkommen zu sichern.
		  Demgegen{\"u}ber war trotz des steuerfreien
		  Existenzminimums die Belastung der Bezieher niedriger
		  Einkommen wegen der indirekten Verbrauchsbesteuerung
		  relative h{\"o}her. All das f{\"o}rderte die Aubildung der
		  Kapitalbildung im Gewerbe-, Industrie-, und
		  Infrastrukturbereich. Die sich im Wachstum herausbildende
		  ungleiche Einkommens- und Verm{\"o}gensverteilung wurde
		  zun{\"a}chst kaum kritisiert."

		  definitive articles about republic constitutions,
		  commercial relations, and international organizations. In
		  his third preliminary article, Kant argues that "Standing
		  Armies (miles perpetuus) Shall in Time be Totally
		  Abolished" because they are themselves "a cause of
		  offensive war." Empirical results based on state-of-the-art
		  data analysis that refers to both peace-years correction

		  obvious among the neglected preliminary articles by
		  Kant--military manpower system--is indeed connected to
		  involvement in militarized interstate disputes during the
		  period from 1886 to 1992. For neo-Kantian peace theory and
		  research, this means that a military manpower system with
		  conscripted, notstanding (i.e., professional or voluntary),
		  soldiers is associated with disputes. },

		  refutes four influential conventional wisdoms about why
		  Pakistanis support Islamic militancy. First, there is no

		  militancy. If anything, support for militant organizations
		  is increasing in terms of both subjective economic
		  well-being and community economic performance. Second,
		  personal religiosity and support for sharia law are poor
		  predictors of support for Islamist militant organizations.
		  Third, support for political goals espoused by legal
		  Islamist parties is a weak indicator of support for
		  militant organizations. Fourth, those who support core
		  democratic principles or have faith in Pakistan's
		  democratic process are not less supportive of militancy.
		  Taken together, these results suggest that commonly

		  development, democratization, and the like-may be

  abstract	= {We present a unified theory and test of extended immediate
		  deterrence-unified in the sense that we employ our
		  theoretical deterrence model as our statistical model in
		  the empirical analysis. The theoretical model is a
		  straightforward formalization of the deterrence logic in
		  Huth (1988) and Huth and Russett (1984), coupled with
		  private information concerning utilities. Our statistical
		  analysis suggests that the attacker and defender's
		  decisions are influenced by the balance of forces, nuclear
		  weapons, defender-protege military alliances, arms
		  transfers, and trade, as well as the regime types of those
		  involved. Many of these findings contradict previous
		  research by Huth (1988) and Huth and Russett (1988). We
		  find that many of the variables involved in the deterrence
		  calculus are nonmonotonically linked to the probability of
		  deterrence success or war. We illustrate the results with
		  case studies of the Soviet-Japanese dispute over Manchukuo
		  (1937-1938) and the Berlin Blockade (1948).},

  abstract	= {The most promising class of statistical models for
		  expressing structural properties of social networks
		  observed at one moment in time is the class of exponential
		  random graph models (ERGMs), also known as p* models. The
		  strong point of these models is that they can represent a
		  variety of structural tendencies, such as transitivity,
		  that define complicated dependence patterns not easily
		  modeled by more basic probability models. Recently, Markov
		  chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms have been developed
		  that produce approximate maximum likelihood estimators.
		  Applying these models in their traditional specification to
		  observed network data often has led to problems, however,
		  which can be traced back to the fact that important parts
		  of the parameter space correspond to nearly degenerate
		  distributions, which may lead to convergence problems of
		  estimation algorithms, and a poor fit to empirical data.
		  This paper proposes new specifications of exponential
		  random graph models. These specifications represent
		  structural properties such as transitivity and
		  heterogeneity of degrees by more complicated graph
		  statistics than the traditional star and triangle counts.
		  Three kinds of statistics are proposed: geometrically
		  weighted degree distributions, alternating k-triangles, and
		  alternating independent two-paths. Examples are presented
		  both of modeling graphs and digraphs, in which the new
		  specifications lead to much better results than the earlier
		  existing specifications of the ERGM. It is concluded that
		  the new specifications increase the range and applicability
		  of the ERGM as a tool for the statistical analysis of
		  social networks.},

		  direct statistical tests inefficient and not necessarily

		  challenges and extend the temporal domain of the democratic
		  peace through an empirical analysis of Renaissance Italy.
		  The data set contains the seven major powers of Renaissance
		  Italy between 1250 and 1494, with measures of war, power,
		  regime type, preferences, and contiguity. The analyses show
		  that joint republicanism, power preponderance, and
		  preference similarity decrease the probability of war. },

		  across an entire epoch of rapid and profound economic
		  transformation, the authors gathered data on the complete
		  ownership histories of 1,696 of the largest Hungarian
		  enterprises from 1987 to 2001. They develop a social
		  sequence analysis to identify distinctive pathways whereby
		  firms use network resources to buffer uncertainty, hide or
		  restructure assets, or gain knowledge and legitimacy.
		  During this period, networked property grew, stabilized,
		  and involved a growing proportion of foreign capital.
		  Cohesive networks of recombinant property were robust, and
		  in fact integrated foreign investment. Although
		  multinationals, through their subsidiaries, dissolved ties
		  in joint venture arrangements, the authors find evidence
		  that they also built durable networks. These findings
		  suggest that developing economies do not necessarily face a
		  forced choice between networks of global reach and those of
		  local embeddedness.},

  abstract	= {Two fundamental arguments are presented to answer whether
		  dyadic balances or preponderances of military capability
		  are more peaceful. First, the impact of the dyadic balance
		  of military capabilities on interstate conflict,
		  conditional on the level of dyadic interest similarity, is
		  assessed. Many theoretical works in the field argue that
		  the degree of interest similarity gives meaning to the
		  balance of military forces, yet few empirical studies
		  investigate the conditionality of these two variables. The
		  second argument is that interstate conflict is a
		  heterogeneous outcome. A selection model that seeks to
		  explain the severity of interstate disputes is used to
		  address this concern. Using data from all interstate dyads
		  between 1886 and 1992, results show that dyads with similar
		  interests have less severe disputes, and under the
		  condition of interest dissimilarity, balances rather than
		  preponderances of military capability are associated with
		  less severe disputes.},

  abstract	= {miquel's reform built on plans that originated around a

		  decentralization of real taxes, and the strengthening of
		  communal units, as this was likely to create advantages for
		  big towns and rich areas with excellent ground (agro). On
		  the other hand, for Miquel the local level responsibility
		  ensured that benefit and cost of taxation would be closely
		  related. Miquel saw the local taxes as strengthening the
		  ability of kreise as an economic union, which' task it was
		  to create the conditions under which the neighborly and
		  economic cohabitation and the employment of its citizens
		  were based. s. 310 herrfurth on the other hand, thought it
		  would be the task of the state to redistribute from richer
		  to poorer localities, something that miquel opposed. In
		  addition, herrfurth fundamentally opposed the treatment of
		  Gutsbezirke (strong landed interest) in which the main
		  wealth would also control the political power, and thus
		  could control their own tax collection. however, this was

		  territory into new, secessionist (e.g., Eritrea) and rump
		  (e.g., Ethiopia) states. Yet, the secession may not have
		  resolved the original dispute to the states' satisfaction.
		  In the aftermath of a secession, the leader of the rump
		  state is motivated to use force by the benefits of retaking
		  (some of) the land lost to the secessionist state, while
		  the secessionist state's leader is motivated by the
		  benefits of acquiring even more land. The peaceful versus
		  violent secession process further affects whether these
		  desires escalate into the use of force. The results--based
		  on the examination of the consequences of all
		  twentieth-century secessions--reveal that ethnically based
		  territorial disputes play a much greater role in conflict
		  onset than do their economically or strategically based
		  counterparts and that peaceful secessions lead to peaceful
		  relations. },

		  to here as "relational demography," is associated with
		  lower effectiveness as perceived by superiors, less
		  personal attraction on the part of superiors for
		  subordinates, and increased role ambiguity experienced by
		  subordinates. These effects were found even after we
		  controlled for the effects of simple demographic

  abstract	= {The Democratic Peace Proposition, which states that no two
		  democracies have ever gone to war with each other, has been
		  questioned by scholars who claim that such pacific behavior
		  among free states does not apply to lower forms of
		  conflict. In particular, Kegley and Hermann contend that
		  democracies intervene in the affairs of other liberal
		  states via overt military acts or covert machinations. In
		  many cases, they argue that dyadic democratic interventions
		  (DDIs) occur more frequently than would be expected given
		  the number of jointly democratic dyads in the international
		  system. I examine their research design and suggest changes
		  to their concepts of states, interventions, and regime
		  type, as well as their sample size and definition of dyads
		  in the international system. I implement these changes and
		  retest such arguments on a sample of interventions from
		  1945 to 1991. I find 11 cases where a democracy intervenes
		  against another democracy, but these cases are rare in
		  comparison to interventions conducted by democratic and/or
		  autocratic states in undemocratic states, or by autocratic
		  states against democratic states. Furthermore, these DDIs
		  are less likely to occur than the presence of democracy in
		  the international system would suggest.},

		  to reformulate its theories in light of criticism accounts
		  for its persistence, it is argued that the proliferation of
		  emendations exposes a degenerating tendency in the
		  paradigm's research program. This article applies Lakatos's
		  criterion that a series of related theories must produce
		  problemshifts that are progressive rather than degenerating
		  to appraise the adequacy of realist-based theories on the
		  balancing of power advanced by neotraditionalists. This
		  research program is seen as degenerating because of (1) the
		  protean character of its theoretical development, (2) an
		  unwillingness to specify what constitutes the true theory,
		  which if falsified would lead to a rejection of the
		  paradigm, (3) a continual adoption of auxiliary
		  propositions to explain away flaws, and (4) a dearth of
		  strong research findings.},

		  landr{\"a}te were ordered to give statistical summeries of
		  their kreise every three years, but again very few followed
		  this order. a year later, no landrat from gumbinnen,
		  marienwerder, brandenburg, or danzig had followed the order
		  and only five out of the 28 in pommern and only two out of
		  the 61 in schlesien. but even when delivered it was clear
		  they were often not correct
		  
		  page 252: hugo solger, landrat in beuthen im
		  abgeordnetenhaus 1869: "Die Steuern gehen ein; aber glauben
		  sie etwa, dass der Ortserheber die Steuerrollen und
		  Heberrollen alle in der Ordnung hat, wie er sie haben soll?
		  Nicht im Mindesten. Er macht sich mit Bleistift in der
		  LIste Zeichen mit Strichen, Kreuzen, Nullen, usw., so dass
		  der Revisor, wenn er kommt, daraus unm{\"o}glich klug
		  werden kann. Aber wenn der Steuertag kommt, so sind die
		  Steuern p{\"u}nktlich da. Wo der Ortserheber sie
		  herbekommt, das ist seine Sache."
		  
		  due to the liberalization of ownership, many land parcels
		  were split and sold to different owners. whenever this
		  happened , the new tax levels should have been assessed and
		  new owners registered, however seldom did the local
		  authorities follow through for all transactions. local
		  bureaucracy was incapable to keep up with the demands what
		  was seen as necessary by the higher ups.
		  
		  reform of political participation, instead of voting rights
		  based on landownership at the local level,i.e. each owner
		  one vote, local votes also connected to income to ensure
		  the continued domincance of rich elites, knights lost
		  influence, power was less heredetary and more given by the
		  state, thus could potentially be taken away..
		  
		  after 1872, increase in power of the landrate, especially
		  since they received more power to spend etc and increase
		  the infrastructure of the kreise.
		  
		  in 1873, the deputy landrat in loebau stepped down after 20
		  years, because of his frugality in terms of investment in
		  road infrastructure he was charged with ''Bef{\"o}rderung

@Article{	  walt:1997,
  abstract	= {John Vasquez's assessment of realism suffers from three
		  serious flaws. First, his reliance on Imre Lakatos's (1970)
		  model of scientific progress is problematic, because the
		  Lakatosian model has been largely rejected by contemporary
		  historians and philosophers of science. Second, Vasquez
		  understates the range and diversity of the realist research
		  program and mistakenly sees disagreements among realists as
		  evidence of theoretical degeneration. Finally, he overlooks
		  the progressive character of contemporary realist theory,
		  largely because he does not consider all the relevant
		  literature. Disagreements within and across competing
		  research programs are essential to progress and should be
		  welcomed, but Vasquez's effort suggests that criticism will
		  be most helpful when it seeks to do more than merely
		  delegitimate a particular research tradition.},

		  to consider the puzzles posed by the interdependence of
		  theory and fact. He places all realists in a single
		  paradigm despite the divergent assumptions of traditional
		  and structural realists. In contrast to Vasquez, I argue
		  that explanation, not prediction, is the ultimate criterion
		  of good theory, that a theory can be validated only by
		  working back and forth between its implications and an
		  uncertain state of affairs that we take to be the reality
		  against which theory is tested, and that the results of

  abstract	= {Militarized interstate disputes are widely thought to be
		  less likely among democratic countries that have high
		  levels of trade and extensive participation in
		  international organizations. We reexamine this broad
		  finding of the Kantian peace literature in the context of a
		  model that incorporates the high degree of dependency among
		  countries. Based on in-sample statistical tests, as well as
		  out-of-sample, predictive cross-validation, we find that
		  results frequently cited in the literature are plagued by
		  overfitting and cannot be characterized as identifying the
		  underlying structure through which international conflict
		  is influenced by democracy, trade, and international
		  governmental organizations. We conclude that much of the
		  statistical association typically reported in this
		  literature apparently stems from three components: (1)
		  geographical proximity, (2) dependence among militarized
		  interstate disputes with the same initiator or target, and
		  (3) the higher-order dependencies in these dyadic data.
		  Once these are incorporated, covariates associated with the
		  Kantian peace tripod lose most of their statistical power.
		  We do find that higher levels of joint democracy are
		  associated with lower probabilities of militarized
		  interstate dispute involvement. We find that despite high
		  statistical significance and putative substantive
		  importance, none of the variables representing the Kantian
		  tripod is associated with any substantial degree of
		  predictive power.},

  abstract	= {The authors examine a standard gravity model of
		  international commerce augmented to include political as
		  well as institutional influences on bilateral trade. Using
		  annual data from 1980-2001, they estimate regression
		  coefficients and residual dependencies using a hierarchy of
		  models in each year. Rather than gauge the generalizability
		  of these patterns via traditional measures of statistical
		  significance such as p-values, this article develops and
		  employs a strategy to evaluate the out-of-sample predictive
		  strength of various models. The analysis of recent
		  international commerce shows that in addition to a typical
		  gravity-model specification, political and institutional
		  variables are important. The article also demonstrates that
		  the often-reported link between international conflict and
		  bilateral trade is elusive, and that inclusion of conflict
		  in a trade model can sometimes lead to reduced
		  out-of-sample predictive performance. Further, this article
		  illustrates that there are substantial, persistent residual
		  exporter- and importer-specific effects, and that ignoring
		  such patterns in relational trade data results in an
		  incomplete picture of international commerce, even in the
		  context of a well-established framework such as the gravity
		  model.},

  abstract	= {Militarized interstate disputes are widely thought to be
		  less likely among democratic countries that have high
		  levels of trade and extensive participation in
		  international organizations. We reexamine this broad
		  finding of the Kantian peace literature in the context of a
		  model that incorporates the high degree of dependency among
		  countries. Based on in-sample statistical tests, as well as
		  out-of-sample, predictive cross-validation, we find that
		  results frequently cited in the literature are plagued by
		  overfitting and cannot be characterized as identifying the
		  underlying structure through which international conflict
		  is influenced by democracy, trade, and international
		  governmental organizations. We conclude that much of the
		  statistical association typically reported in this
		  literature apparently stems from three components: (1)
		  geographical proximity, (2) dependence among militarized
		  interstate disputes with the same initiator or target, and
		  (3) the higher-order dependencies in these dyadic data.
		  Once these are incorporated, covariates associated with the
		  Kantian peace tripod lose most of their statistical power.
		  We do find that higher levels of joint democracy are
		  associated with lower probabilities of militarized
		  interstate dispute involvement. We find that despite high
		  statistical significance and putative substantive
		  importance, none of the variables representing the Kantian
		  tripod is associated with any substantial degree of
		  predictive power.},

@Article{	  wendt:1992,
  abstract	= {The claim that international institutions can transform
		  state interests is central to neoliberal challenges to the
		  realist assumption that "process" (interaction and learning
		  among states) cannot fundamentally affect system
		  "structure" (anarchy and the distribution of capabilities).
		  Systematic development of this claim, however, has been
		  hampered by the neoliberals' commitment to rational choice
		  theory, which treats interests as exogenously given and
		  thus offers only a weak form of institutional analysis. A
		  growing body of international relations scholarship points
		  to ways in which the identities and interests of states are
		  socially constructed by knowledgeable practice. This
		  article builds a bridge between this scholarship and
		  neoliberalism by developing a theory of identity- and
		  interest-formation in support of the neoliberal claim that
		  international institutions can transform state interests.
		  Its substantive focus is the realist view that anarchies
		  are necessarily self-help systems, which justifies
		  disinterest in processes of identity- and
		  interest-formation. Self-help is a function not of anarchy
		  but of process and, as such, is itself an institution that
		  determines the meaning of anarchy and the distribution of
		  power for state action. The article concludes with an
		  examination of how this institution can be transformed by
		  practices of sovereignty, by an evolution of cooperation,
		  and by critical strategic practice.},

  abstract	= {The Rational Design project is impressive on its own
		  terms. However, it does not address other approaches
		  relevant to the design of international institutions. To
		  facilitate comparison I survey two "contrast spaces" around
		  it. The first shares the project's central question-What
		  explains institutional design?-but addresses alternative
		  explanations of two types: rival explanations and
		  explanations complementary but deeper in the causal chain.
		  The second contrast begins with a different question: What
		  kind of knowledge is needed to design institutions in the
		  real world? Asking this question reveals epistemological
		  differences between positive social science and
		  institutional design that can be traced to different
		  orientations toward time. Making institutions is about the
		  future and has an intrinsic normative element. Explaining
		  institutions is about the past and does not necessarily
		  have this normative dimension. To avoid "driving with the
		  rearview mirror" we need two additional kinds of knowledge
		  beyond that developed in this volume, knowledge about
		  institutional effectiveness and knowledge about what values
		  to pursue. As such, the problem of institutional design is
		  a fruitful site for developing a broader and more practical
		  conception of social science that integrates normative and
		  positive concerns.},

@Article{	  williamreed02012003,
  abstract	= {The pacifying effect of economic interdependence on
		  conflict onset can be better understood in the context of
		  "noisy" bargaining. Specifically, trading states bargain
		  under less noisy conditions and, as a result, are unlikely
		  to engage in militarized conflict. Noise is introduced into
		  a generic take-it-or-leave-it bargaining game in the form
		  of nonspecific asymmetric information about the defender's
		  reservation value. Comparative statics show a positive
		  monotonic relationship between variance in the noise term
		  and the onset of militarized conflict. The relationships
		  among economic interdependence, variance in the noise term,
		  and conflict onset are evaluated with a Bayesian
		  heteroskedastic probit model. Historical data are used to
		  demonstrate that interdependence and uncertainty are
		  related to each other and jointly related to the onset of
		  militarized conflict. Uncertainty appears to be reduced by
		  economic interdependence, and this leads to an enhanced
		  probability of agreement short of a militarized clash. },

@Article{	  yakubovich:2005,
  abstract	= {In 1973 Granovetter formulated the strength-of-weak-ties
		  hypothesis (SWT), which became the foundation of a vast
		  sociological literature on social networks in labor
		  markets. Until now, SWT has never been directly tested but
		  treated instead as a surrogate for the relationship between
		  an actor's network and labor market outcomes such as
		  characteristics of a job obtained. The paper restates SWT
		  as a proposition about the probability of getting a job as
		  a function of within-actor differences in tie strength and
		  tests it with data on hires carried out in one Russian city
		  in 1998. In support of SWT, the results show that a worker
		  is more likely to get a job through one of her weak ties
		  rather than strong ties. The advantages of weak ties lie in
		  their abilities to provide timely access to non-redundant
		  information and to influence employers directly. In
		  contrast, strong ties are associated with indirect
		  influence on employers through well-connected
		  intermediaries. The estimates come from a within-worker
		  fixed-effect conditional logistic regression and thereby
		  provide rare evidence of an association between information
		  and influence transferred through social ties and labor
		  market outcomes, independent of workers' individual
		  characteristics.},

  abstract	= {The concept of international affinity--albeit under
		  different names--captures a central place in international
		  relations research. This study examines how different types
		  of affinity affect the likelihood of conflict between
		  states. The authors discuss different types of affinities
		  as these appear in the realist and liberal paradigms. They
		  offer a social networks conception of structural
		  affinity--the concept of structural equivalence--which
		  reflects the similarity of international ties across a set
		  of different networks. They test the hypotheses derived
		  from these paradigms, using both existing measures of
		  affinity and their own structural equivalence measures.
		  Their findings suggest that (1) strategic affinity has a
		  consistent dampening effect on the probability of dyadic
		  conflict, (2) trade-related affinity does consistently
		  affect the probability of dyadic conflict, and (3)
		  intergovernmental organization-related affinity has a
		  negative impact on conflict, mostly in the twentieth
		  century. },
